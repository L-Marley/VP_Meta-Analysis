Furthermore, the dimensions they report the means and SDs for don't strictly match those of the AMQ, some are clearly analogues. But the combination of these two points makes me unsure how true to vividness, the 'detail' dimension might be (assuming that is what it's meant to represent). 

Exact group sizes unknown, a range is given, so the median of the range was chosen each time, and rounded down to be conservative. "

Session 2 was chosen because it allows for a comparison between first and third person perspective with known group sizes, and at the participant level of analysis. 

Choice between the field vs observer event was arbitary and done to avoid the issues of assuming the covariance matrix to be able to aggregate the SDs (they are paired data). Mainly due to how many assumptions about covariances that will have to be made to do the multivariate analysis.

The means and SDs for emotional intensity are not available

I've ignored their ANCOVA analysis results because they've violated the major assumption of the analysis and these will be spurious at best. 

They suggest rehearsal frequency and memory age were reported but I cannot find values for these in the results section. "
