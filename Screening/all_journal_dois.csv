"B. Adams, A. Chan, H. Callahan and N. W. Milgram",2000,The canine as a model of human cognitive aging: Recent developments,"Discusses the development of a canine model of cognitive aging, and reviews relevant studies. Dogs display many of the cognitive impairments associated with human aging and dementia. As well, aged dogs display a wide range of individual variability in cognitive functioning. Different categories of aged canines can be identified on the basis of cognitive test performance, and these categories can be used to model different subgroups of aged dogs. Advantages of a dog model of human cognitive aging include ease of acquisition and maintenance, the lack of deprivation needed for motivation, similar patterns of cognitive decline as a function of age, and similarities between dog- and human-related neuropathologies. The canine model has been examined in studies concerning procedural learning, discrimination and reversal learning, visual recognition memory, allocentric spatial learning, spatial learning and memory, procedural memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, and remote memory. Lesion, neurochemical, and neuropathological studies are currently in progress.

"D. R. Addis, A. T. Wong and D. L. Schacter",2007,Remembering the past and imagining the future: Common and distinct neural substrates during event construction and elaboration,"People can consciously re-experience past events and pre-experience possible future events. This fMRI study examined the neural regions mediating the construction and elaboration of past and future events. Participants were cued with a noun for 20 s and instructed to construct a past or future event within a specified time period (week, year, 5-20 years). Once participants had the event in mind, they made a button press and for the remainder of the 20 s elaborated on the event. Importantly, all events generated were episodic and did not differ on a number of phenomenological qualities (detail, emotionality, personal significance, field/observer perspective). Conjunction analyses indicated the left hippocampus was commonly engaged by past and future event construction, along with posterior visuospatial regions, but considerable neural differentiation was also observed during the construction phase. Future events recruited regions involved in prospective thinking and generation processes, specifically right frontopolar cortex and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. Furthermore, future event construction uniquely engaged the right hippocampus, possibly as a response to the novelty of these events. In contrast to the construction phase, elaboration was characterized by remarkable overlap in regions comprising the autobiographical memory retrieval network, attributable to the common processes engaged during elaboration, including self-referential processing, contextual and episodic imagery. This striking neural overlap is consistent with findings that amnesic patients exhibit deficits in both past and future thinking, and confirms that the episodic system contributes importantly to imagining the future.

Pearce",2009,Lesions of the fornix and anterior thalamic nuclei dissociate different aspects of hippocampal-dependent spatial learning: Implications for the neural basis of scene learning,"The present study used 2 different discrimination tasks designed to isolate distinct components of visuospatial learning: structural learning and geometric learning. Structural learning refers to the ability to learn the precise combination of stimulus identity with stimulus location. Rats with anterior thalamic lesions and fornix lesions were unimpaired on a configural learning task in which the rats learned 3 concurrent mirror-image discriminations (structural learning). Indeed, both lesions led to facilitated learning. In contrast, anterior thalamic lesions impaired the geometric discrimination (e.g., swim to the corner with the short wall to the right of the long wall). Finally, both the fornix and anterior thalamic lesions severely impaired T-maze alternation, a task that taxes an array of spatial strategies including allocentric learning. This pattern of dissociations and double dissociations highlights how distinct classes of spatial learning rely on different systems, even though they may converge on the hippocampus. Consequently, the findings suggest that structural learning is heavily dependent on cortico-hippocampal interactions. In contrast, subcortical inputs (such as those from the anterior thalamus) contribute to geometric learning.

"F. Ahs, J. E. Dunsmoor, D. Zielinski and K. S. LaBar",2015,Spatial proximity amplifies valence in emotional memory and defensive approach-avoidance,"In urban areas, people often have to stand or move in close proximity to others. The egocentric distance to stimuli is a powerful determinant of defensive behavior in animals. Yet, little is known about how spatial proximity to others alters defensive responses in humans. We hypothesized that the valence of social cues scales with egocentric distance, such that proximal social stimuli have more positive or negative valence than distal stimuli. This would predict enhanced defensive responses to proximal threat and reduced defensive responses to proximal reward. We tested this hypothesis across four experiments using 3-D virtual reality simulations. Results from Experiment 1 confirmed that proximal social stimuli facilitate defensive responses, as indexed by fear-potentiated startle, relative to distal stimuli. Experiment 2 revealed that interpersonal defensive boundaries flexibly increase with aversive learning. Experiment 3 examined whether spatial proximity enhances memory for aversive experiences. Fear memories for social threats encroaching on the body were more persistent than those acquired at greater interpersonal distances, as indexed by startle. Lastly, Experiment 4 examined how egocentric distance influenced startle responses to social threats during defensive approach and avoidance. Whereas fear-potentiated startle increased with proximity when participants actively avoided receiving shocks, startle decreased with proximity when participants tolerated shocks to receive monetary rewards, implicating opposing gradients of distance on threat versus reward. Thus, proximity in egocentric space amplifies the valence of social stimuli that, in turn, facilitates emotional memory and approach-avoidance responses. These findings have implications for understanding the consequences of increased urbanization on affective interpersonal behavior.",Neuropsychologia,70,,476-485,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.12.018
J. A. Ainge and R. F. Langston,2012,Ontogeny of neural circuits underlying spatial memory in the rat,"Spatial memory is a well-characterized psychological function in both humans and rodents. The combined computations of a network of systems including place cells in the hippocampus, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and head direction cells found in numerous structures in the brain have been suggested to form the neural instantiation of the cognitive map as first described by Tolman in 1948. However, while our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying spatial representations in adults is relatively sophisticated, we know substantially less about how this network develops in young animals. In this article we briefly review studies examining the developmental timescale that these systems follow. Electrophysiological recordings from very young rats show that directional information is at adult levels at the outset of navigational experience. The systems supporting allocentric memory, however, take longer to mature. This is consistent with behavioral studies of young rats which show that spatial memory based on head direction develops very early but that allocentric spatial memory takes longer to mature. We go on to report new data demonstrating that memory for associations between objects and their spatial locations is slower to develop than memory for objects alone. This is again consistent with previous reports suggesting that adult like spatial representations have a protracted development in rats and also suggests that the systems involved in processing non-spatial stimuli come online earlier.",Frontiers in Neural Circuits,6,,8,10.3389/fncir.2012.00008
"S. Akhtar, L. V. Justice, C. Loveday and M. A. Conway",2017,Switching memory perspective,"The perspective in which memories were spontaneously recalled, field (original perspective) or observer (see oneself in the memory), was examined for both recent and remote memories. Recent memories were dominated by field perspective whilst remote memories were dominated by observer perspective. Further, field memories contained reliably more episodic detail than observer memories. After a 1-week interval, the same memories were recalled again but with a switched memory perspective. Switching from an observer to a field perspective did not reliably increase the amount of episodic details in a memory. Switching from field to observer perspective did, however, reliably reduce the number of episodic details. These findings suggest that memories may be represented in long-term memory with a fixed perspective, either field or observer, which can be temporarily altered sometimes changing the nature of a memory, i.e. how much detail remains accessible.",Conscious Cogn,56,,50-57,10.1016/j.concog.2017.10.006

A variety of disorders affecting autobiographical memory are characterized by the difficulty of retrieving specific detailed memories of past personal events. Owing to the impact of autobiographical memory impairment on patients' daily life, it is necessary to better understand these deficits and develop relevant methods to improve autobiographical memory. The primary objective of the present systematic PRISMA review was to give an overview of the first empirical evidence of the potential of wearable cameras in autobiographical memory investigation in remediating autobiographical memory impairments. The peer-reviewed literature published since 2004 on the usefulness of wearable cameras in research protocols was explored in 3 databases (PUBMED, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar). Twenty-eight published studies that used a protocol involving wearable camera, either to explore wearable camera functioning and impact on daily life, or to investigate autobiographical memory processing or remediate autobiographical memory impairment, were included. This review analyzed the potential of wearable cameras for 1) investigating autobiographical memory processes in healthy volunteers without memory impairment and in clinical populations, and 2) remediating autobiographical memory in patients with various kinds of memory disorder. Mechanisms to account for the efficacy of wearable cameras are also discussed. The review concludes by discussing certain limitations inherent to using cameras, and new research perspectives. Finally, ethical issues raised by this new technology are considered.",Neuropsychology Review,27,1,81-99,10.1007/s11065-016-9337-x
"J. A. Araujo, A. D. Chan, L. L. Winka, P. A. Seymour and N. W. Milgram",2004,"Dose-specific effects of scopolamine on canine cognition: impairment of visuospatial memory, but not visuospatial discrimination","RATIONALE: The cholinergic system is linked extensively to memory, but its exact role remains controversial. In particular, scopolamine-induced impairment in rodents is not task specific, which may be due to difficulty in developing rodent protocols to assess deficits in recent memory, in which the remembered event is brief and distinct, and/or to non-specific behavioral impairment. OBJECTIVES: The present study sought to determine whether scopolamine-induced deficits in recent memory, using a working memory task, could be dose-specifically dissociated from deficits in associative memory in dogs. METHODS: A Latin-square design was used to determine the effect of scopolamine (5, 10 and 15 microg/kg; SC) on a variable delayed-non-matching-to-position (DNMP) task, which assesses visuospatial working memory. Subsequently, the minimal effective dose (15 microg/kg; SC) was administered prior to testing on a landmark discrimination task, which provides a measure of allocentric spatial ability, a black-white discrimination task, an oddity discrimination task and tests of exploratory behavior. We also investigated the effects of a 30 microg/kg dose (SC) on tests of oddity discrimination and behavioral activity. RESULTS: A 15 microg/kg dose produced significant impairment on the DNMP task, but did not affect performance of any discrimination task and did not alter behavior on tests of open field or curiosity. A 30 microg/kg dose caused disruption on discrimination performance and on open field measures. CONCLUSIONS: Working memory performance is most sensitive to scopolamine-induced impairment and can be dissociated from scopolamine-induced deficits in discrimination performance and non-cognitive behaviors. The present results indicate that scopolamine-induced impairments of working memory in the dog can serve as a model of age-related cholinergic dysfunction.",Psychopharmacology (Berl),175,1,92-98,
"A. Arora, B. Weiss, M. Schurz, M. Aichhorn, R. C. Wieshofer and J. Perner",2015,Left inferior-parietal lobe activity in perspective tasks: Identity statements,"We investigate the theory that the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) is closely associated with tracking potential differences of perspective. Developmental studies find that perspective tasks are mastered at around 4 years of age. Our first study, meta-analyses of brain imaging studies shows that perspective tasks specifically activate a region in the left IPL and precuneus. These tasks include processing of false belief, visual perspective, and episodic memory. We test the location specificity theory in our second study with an unusual and novel kind of perspective task: identity statements. According to Frege’s classical logical analysis, identity statements require appreciation of modes of presentation (perspectives). We show that identity statements, e.g., “the tour guide is also the driver” activate the left IPL in contrast to a control statements, “the tour guide has an apprentice.” This activation overlaps with the activations found in the meta-analysis. This finding is confirmed in a third study with different types of statements and different comparisons. All studies support the theory that the left IPL has as one of its overarching functions the tracking of perspective differences. We discuss how this function relates to the bottom-up attention function proposed for the bilateral IPL.

S. Arzy,2013,"When speaking of the experience, do not leave out the experiencer: On self and magnitude","This opinion article discusses different aspects of the subjective experience. Similarly to navigation, memory encompasses autobiographical memory, related to events that happened to the experiencer (self-referenced), and semantic memory of events that the experiencer “knows”. Perception may be taken from a self-referenced first-person-perspective or from a third-person-perspective. Correspondingly, in the affective plane, emotion may be self-referenced, reflecting the experiencer own-feelings, or may be dominated by a third-person-perspective, when the experiencer is absorbed in the life of others. Taken together, this suggests that different aspects of the subjective experience should be regarded in relation to the experiencing self. Self-related mentalization may have a specific logarithmic pattern, reflected as a “mental-line.” The temporo-parietal junction may play a special role in mediating these self-referenced functions in the different domains.

Gutyrchik",2014,Neural correlates of moral judgments in first- and third-person perspectives: implications for neuroethics and beyond,"BACKGROUND: There appears to be an inconsistency in experimental paradigms used in fMRI research on moral judgments. As stimuli, moral dilemmas or moral statements/ pictures that induce emotional reactions are usually employed; a main difference between these stimuli is the perspective of the participants reflecting first-person (moral dilemmas) or third-person perspective (moral reactions). The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to investigate the neural correlates of moral judgments in either first- or third-person perspective. RESULTS: Our results indicate that different neural mechanisms appear to be involved in these perspectives. Although conjunction analysis revealed common activation in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, third person-perspective elicited unique activations in hippocampus and visual cortex. The common activation can be explained by the role the anterior medial prefrontal cortex may play in integrating different information types and also by its involvement in theory of mind. Our results also indicate that the so-called actor-observer bias affects moral evaluation in the third-person perspective, possibly due to the involvement of the hippocampus. We suggest two possible ways in which the hippocampus may support the process of moral judgment: by the engagement of episodic memory and its role in understanding the behaviors and emotions of others. CONCLUSION: We posit that these findings demonstrate that first or third person perspectives in moral cognition involve distinct neural processes, that are important to different aspects of moral judgments. These results are important to a deepened understanding of neural correlates of moral cognition-the so-called first tradition of neuroethics, with the caveat that any results must be interpreted and employed with prudence, so as to heed neuroethics second tradition that sustains the pragmatic evaluation of outcomes, capabilities and limitations of neuroscientific techniques and technologies.",BMC Neurosci,15,,39,10.1186/1471-2202-15-39

"B. J. Baars, S. Franklin and T. Z. Ramsoy",2013,Global workspace dynamics: Cortical binding and propagation enables conscious contents,"A global workspace (GW) is a functional hub of binding and propagation in a population of loosely coupled signaling elements. In computational applications, GW architectures recruit many distributed, specialized agents to cooperate in resolving focal ambiguities. In the brain, conscious experiences may reflect a GW function. For animals, the natural world is full of unpredictable dangers and opportunities, suggesting a general adaptive pressure for brains to resolve focal ambiguities quickly and accurately. GW theory aims to understand the differences between conscious and unconscious brain events. In humans and related species the cortico-thalamic (C-T) core is believed to underlie conscious aspects of perception, thinking, learning, feelings of knowing (FOK), felt emotions, visual imagery, working memory, and executive control. Alternative theoretical perspectives are also discussed. The C-T core has many anatomical hubs, but conscious percepts are unitary and internally consistent at any given moment. Over time, conscious contents constitute a very large, open set.This suggests that a brain-based GW capacity cannot be localized in a single anatomical hub. Rather, it should be sought in a functional hub—a dynamic capacity for binding and propagation of neural signals over multiple task-related networks, a kind of neuronal cloud computing. In this view, conscious contents can arise in any region of the C-T core when multiple input streams settle on a winner-take-all equilibrium. The resulting conscious gestalt may ignite an any-to-many broadcast, lasting ∼100–200 ms, and trigger widespread adaptation in previously established networks. To account for the great range of conscious contents over time, the theory suggests an open repertoire of binding1 coalitions that can broadcast via theta/gamma or alpha/gamma phase coupling, like radio channels competing for a narrow frequency band. Conscious moments are thought to hold only 1–4 unrelated items; this small focal capacity may be the biological price to pay for global access. Visuotopic maps in cortex specialize in features like color, retinal size, motion, object identity, and egocentric/allocentric framing, so that a binding coalition for the sight of a rolling billiard ball in nearby space may resonate among activity maps of LGN, V1-V4, MT, IT, as well as the dorsal stream. Spatiotopic activity maps can bind into coherent gestalts using adaptive resonance (reentry). Single neurons can join a dominant coalition by phase tuning to regional oscillations in the 4–12 Hz range. Sensory percepts may bind and broadcast from posterior cortex, while non-sensory FOKs may involve prefrontal and frontotemporal areas.The anatomy and physiology of the hippocampal complex suggest a GW architecture as well. In the intact brain the hippocampal complex may support conscious event organization as well as episodic memory storage.

Two experiments examined the influence of memory perspective on objective memory performance. In both experiments participants were presented with a series of verbal passages, each of which contained several different categories of information. For four of these categories (pertaining to affective reactions, physical sensations, psychological states, and associated ideas), recall was significantly higher when a field perspective was adopted than when an observer perspective was adopted, but for the five other categories (pertaining to physical actions, personal appearance, fine details, spatial relations, and peripheral details) there was no significant effect of perspective upon recall.

"P. Banta Lavenex, V. Boujon, A. Ndarugendamwo and P. Lavenex",2015,Human short-term spatial memory: precision predicts capacity,"Here, we aimed to determine the capacity of human short-term memory for allocentric spatial information in a real-world setting. Young adults were tested on their ability to learn, on a trial-unique basis, and remember over a 1-min interval the location(s) of 1, 3, 5, or 7 illuminating pads, among 23 pads distributed in a 4mx4m arena surrounded by curtains on three sides. Participants had to walk to and touch the pads with their foot to illuminate the goal locations. In contrast to the predictions from classical slot models of working memory capacity limited to a fixed number of items, i.e., Miller's magical number 7 or Cowan's magical number 4, we found that the number of visited locations to find the goals was consistently about 1.6 times the number of goals, whereas the number of correct choices before erring and the number of errorless trials varied with memory load even when memory load was below the hypothetical memory capacity. In contrast to resource models of visual working memory, we found no evidence that memory resources were evenly distributed among unlimited numbers of items to be remembered. Instead, we found that memory for even one individual location was imprecise, and that memory performance for one location could be used to predict memory performance for multiple locations. Our findings are consistent with a theoretical model suggesting that the precision of the memory for individual locations might determine the capacity of human short-term memory for spatial information.",Cogn Psychol,77,,1-19,10.1016/j.cogpsych.2015.02.001
T. Bast,2007,Toward an integrative perspective on hippocampal function: From the rapid encoding of experience to adaptive behavior,"The mammalian hippocampus has been associated with learning and memory, as well as with many other behavioral processes. In this article, these different perspectives are brought together, and it is pointed out that integration of diverse functional domains may be a key feature enabling the hippocampus to support not only the encoding and retrieval of certain memory representations, but also their translation into adaptive behavior. The hippocampus appears to combine: (i) sensory afferents and synaptic mechanisms underlying certain types of rapid learning; and (ii) links to motivational, emotional, executive, and sensorimotor functions. Recent experiments are highlighted, indicating that the induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity is required to encode rapidly aspects of experience, such as places, into memory representations; subsequent retrieval of these representations requires transmission through the previously modified hippocampal synapses, but no further plasticity. In contrast, slow incremental place learning may not absolutely require hippocampal contributions. The neocortical sensory inputs, especially visuo-spatial information, necessary for hippocampus-dependent rapid learning, are preferentially associated with the septal to intermediate hippocampus. In contrast, connectivity with the prefrontal cortex and subcortical sites, which link the hippocampus to motivational, emotional, executive, and sensorimotor functions, is primarily associated with the intermediate to temporal hippocampus. A model of functional differentiation and integration along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus is proposed, describing key hippocampal contributions to adaptive behavior based on information encoded during a single or a few past experiences.",Reviews in the Neurosciences,18,3-4,253-281,
"T. Bast, B. M. da Silva and R. G. Morris",2005,Distinct contributions of hippocampal NMDA and AMPA receptors to encoding and retrieval of one-trial place memory,"Allocentric place memory may serve to specify the context of events stored in human episodic memory. Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that, analogous to event-place associations in episodic memory, rats could associate, within one trial, a specific food flavor with an allocentrically defined place in an open arena. Encoding, but not retrieval, of such flavor-place associations required hippocampal NMDA receptors; retrieval depended on hippocampal AMPA receptors. This might have partly reflected the contributions of these receptors to encoding and retrieval of one-trial place, rather than flavor-place, memory. Therefore, the present study developed a food-reinforced arena paradigm to study encoding and retrieval of one-trial allocentric place memory in rats; memory relied on visuospatial information and declined with increasing retention delay, still being significant after 6 h, the longest delay tested (experiments 1 and 2). Hippocampal infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist d-AP-5 blocked encoding without affecting retrieval; hippocampal infusion of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX impaired retrieval (experiment 3). Finally, we confirmed that the d-AP-5 infusions selectively blocked induction of long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity, whereas CNQX impaired fast excitatory transmission, at perforant-path dentate gyrus synapses in the dorsal hippocampus in vivo (experiment 4). Our results support that encoding, but not retrieval, of one-trial allocentric place memory requires the NMDA receptor-dependent induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, whereas retrieval depends on AMPA receptor-mediated fast excitatory hippocampal transmission. The contributions of hippocampal NMDA and AMPA receptors to one-trial allocentric place memory may be central to episodic memory and related episodic-like forms of memory in rats.",J Neurosci,25,25,5845-5856,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0698-05.2005
R.-P. Behrendt,2010,Contribution of hippocampal region CA3 to consciousness and schizophrenic hallucinations,"Recent advances in understanding hippocampal information processing offer new vistas on the mind-body and binding problems. Information encoded by the autoassociation network of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) situates landmarks and objects within an allocentric framework of space and time. Guiding locomotion across the spatial environment, and generally organizing behaviour that transcends space and time, the hippocampus creates phenomenal space and time themselves, thus laying the foundations for conscious awareness. It is argued that conscious experience describes/symbolizes the informational content of self-organizing activity patterns in CA3. Imagery, conscious perception or hallucinations do not in themselves affect the physical trajectory of behaviour but are evidence for patterns of neuronal activity that, acting via the medial prefrontal cortex, modulate action dispositions and influence prefrontal top-down attentional control of sensory processing and thus subsequent event memory formation. Evidence for GABAergic deficit and pyramidal cell hyperexcitability in CA3 in patients with schizophrenia is consistent with the notion that binding, by the CA3 network, of cortical modules representing weakly related sensory representations underlies hallucinations in this disorder.

R.-P. Behrendt,2013,Hippocampus and consciousness,"An important assumption concerning the physiology of consciousness is that all varieties of conscious experience are closely related to each other and, hence, are subserved by the same neural mechanism. There are several considerations that lead us to implicate the hippocampus in the generation of conscious perception and, ultimately, of conscious experiences of all kinds. Firstly, conscious perception of external events is intricately linked with the formation of episodic (declarative) memories, a key function attributed to the hippocampus. Secondly, conscious experience is allocentric and contextualized. Consciousness creates or simulates an image of the world that appears to surround us and to be independent of our observation of it. What is characteristic of wakeful consciousness and dreaming alike is that objects or events are experienced as being embedded in an external, that is, allocentric, frame of space and time. The hippocampus has been implicated in the rapid formation and memorization of allocentric representations that embed objects or events in a world context. Thirdly, the hippocampus is ideally positioned to bind information processed in different sensory association cortices. It is argued that rapidly forming patterns of neuronal ensemble firing in the hippocampus, particularly in region CA3, which encode arbitrary associations between objects and their spatiotemporal and emotional context, that is, associations between information derived from different neocortical processing streams, define the informational content of consciousness. Evidence suggestive of an important contribution of the hippocampus to conscious observation, mental imagery, dreaming, conscious anticipation of outcomes, and hallucinations will be reviewed.

R.-P. Behrendt,2013,Conscious experience and episodic memory: Hippocampus at the crossroads,"If an instance of conscious experience of the seemingly objective world around us could be regarded as a newly formed event memory, much as an instance of mental imagery has the content of a retrieved event memory, and if, therefore, the stream of conscious experience could be seen as evidence for ongoing formation of event memories that are linked into episodic memory sequences, then unitary conscious experience could be defined as a symbolic representation of the pattern of hippocampal neuronal firing that encodes an event memory—a theoretical stance that may shed light into the mind-body and binding problems in consciousness research. Exceedingly detailed symbols that describe patterns of activity rapidly self-organizing, at each cycle of the θ rhythm, in the hippocampus are instances of unitary conscious experience that jointly constitute the stream of consciousness. Integrating object information (derived from the ventral visual stream and orbitofrontal cortex) with contextual emotional information (from the anterior insula) and spatial environmental information (from the dorsal visual stream), the hippocampus rapidly forms event codes that have the informational content of objects embedded in an emotional and spatiotemporally extending context. Event codes, formed in the CA3-dentate network for the purpose of their memorization, are not only contextualized but also allocentric representations, similarly to conscious experiences of events and objects situated in a seemingly objective and observer-independent framework of phenomenal space and time. Conscious perception, creating the spatially and temporally extending world that we perceive around us, is likely to be evolutionarily related to more fleeting and seemingly internal forms of conscious experience, such as autobiographical memory recall, mental imagery, including goal anticipation, and to other forms of externalized conscious experience, namely dreaming and hallucinations; and evidence pointing to an important contribution of the hippocampus to these conscious phenomena will be reviewed.

R.-P. Behrendt,2016,Hallucinatory experience as aberrant event memory formation: Implications for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,"If hallucinations are not fundamentally different from normal wakeful experiences, then the neural basis of hallucinations has to be essentially that of consciousness in general. The additional insight that consciousness reflects the formation (as opposed to consolidation) of event (episodic) memories links the pathophysiology of hallucinations to the hippocampus. Perceptions and misperceptions, insofar as they are consciously experienced, constitute contextualized and unitary phenomena (which are embedded as discrete events in the stream of consciousness); they are experiential manifestations of activity patters that recurrently emerge in the CA3 network of the hippocampus (and that are secondarily consolidated into retrievable and declarable memories).

In the original article, the Highlights section of the article was imprecise. The correct Highlights was present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-42337-026). If hallucinations are not fundamentally different from normal wakeful experiences, then the neural basis of hallucinations has to be essentially that of consciousness in general. The additional insight that consciousness reflects the formation (as opposed to consolidation) of event (episodic) memories links the pathophysiology of hallucinations to the hippocampus. Perceptions and misperceptions, insofar as they are consciously experienced, constitute contextualized and unitary phenomena (which are embedded as discrete events in the stream of consciousness); they are experiential manifestations of activity patters that recurrently emerge in the CA3 network of the hippocampus (and that are secondarily consolidated into retrievable and declarable memories). The hippocampus, forming allocentric representations of objects in their world context (event memories), is a point of convergence of neocortical sensory processing streams. Moreover, being extensively modulated by the organism's physiological state, the hippocampus embeds such representations in an emotional context and, through its output to the medial prefrontal cortex, guides decision-making and goal-selection processes. Although sensory and associative processing in the neocortex makes an important contribution to the formation of behaviourally adaptive representations in the hippocampus, it is becoming clearer that pattern formation in the hippocampus is in itself the neural correlate of consciousness and that disruptions in relational memory processing in the hippocampus can give rise to hallucinations.

R. P. Behrendt,2017,Hippocampus as a wormhole: Gateway to consciousness,"Comments on an article by Matt Faw and Bill Faw (see record 2016-46042-001). Faw and Faw proceed from the well-established notion that conscious experience is a subjective phenomenon and not a depiction of objective (material) reality and not even a reconstitution of inputs from the senses. However, Faw and Faw propose that this latter feedback pathway gives rise to conscious experience of newly formed or recalled memories. Moreover, information represented in higher-order neocortical sensory-processing areas is more suitable for interaction with the environment (egocentric action-oriented representations) than for inclusion, as facets, into an allocentric image of the world. The question should be permitted as to why we feel we have to implicate neocortical areas in the generation of consciousness. If the hippocampus is an ‘experience simulator,’ then why do we have to maintain that conscious experience arises from neocortical activity? This question does not seem to be answered by Faw and Faw, and an answer to it has long been elusive. The more general question as to how consciousness can arise from physical (neuronal) processes is left unanswered, too. Consciousness is not necessary for responding to the world, as Faw and Faw clearly show, but the neural patterns underpinning consciousness (the attractor states in CA3) are nevertheless pertinent to behavior, not to the responding to individual stimuli but to the adjustment of the organism’s behavior to the location or situation in which it finds itself.

The main goal of the present study was to further explore episodic specificity of AM among fully remitted depressed patients. Twenty euthymic depressed patients and 20 matched healthy controls were given a semi-structured interview, which assesses episodic specificity of positive and negative autobiographical memories regarding event and details' specificity, autonoetic consciousness (remember/know procedure) and visual perspective (field/observer procedure). Results showed an impairment of episodic specificity of AM in euthymic depressed patients. This impairment was explained by a field perspective deficit for positive memories only. These results suggest that euthymic patients continue to exhibit discrepancy between their current self and their self for positive past behaviors, which maintains an unfavorable view of their current self.

However, until recently, the understanding of these disorders referred mostly to philosophical considerations. The aim of this work is to examine how the various aspects of autobiographical memory deficits may be considered as possible cognitive mechanisms accounting for self-disorders in patients. METHODS: We performed a theoretical review of the literature on autobiographical memory studies in schizophrenia. Our approach of cognitive psychopathology was grounded in the model of the Self-Memory System put forward by Conway (2005), which posits reciprocal relationships between autobiographical memory and the self. This model stresses the distinction between the working-self and the autobiographical memory knowledge base. The latter contains all autobiographical information stored in our life and is organized according to the specificity of this information. The role of the working-self is to maintain the coherence of the self and to control the access to autobiographical memories and corresponding memory details. The working-self supports an experiential or phenomenological dimension of the self, especially when a highly detailed autobiographical memory is retrieved, and a past event is re-experienced by the rememberer. The working-self also entails a conceptual part, the conceptual self, which contains self-knowledge and self-images. RESULTS: Our review showed that autobiographical memories of patients with schizophrenia are less specific and contain fewer phenomenological details than those of healthy participants. Patients also have difficulty assessing the subjective temporal distance of past events, and their ability to re-experience unique past personal events is affected as shown by a reduced conscious recollection and a smaller frequency of Field visual perspective during recall of autobiographical memories. This global alteration of all phenomenological characteristics of autobiographical memories strongly suggests an alteration of the phenomenological dimension of the self in schizophrenia. Since some of these alterations are also found in patients when they plan for future personal events, the ability to mentally travel in time is reduced in patients and reflects an impaired sense of self across time. The literature also shows that self-images are more passive, less coherent and less stable in time in patients compared to healthy participants. These results point to an alteration of the conceptual dimension of the self in schizophrenia. This may be partly explained by a weaker connection between the self and autobiographical memory and by other alterations of autobiographical memories closely linked to the self. In fact, the reminiscence bump is disorganized in patients and comprises poorly detailed memories. Memories grounding self-images are less organized and weakly connected to self-images. Finally, patients have an impaired ability to give a meaning to or to draw lessons from self-defining memories of their life.

These methods appear relevant to help patients improve both the sense of self associatied with their autobiographical memory retrieval and the coherence and stability of the self.",Encephale,43,1,47-54,10.1016/j.encep.2016.04.003

Notre analyse a été construite en référence au modèle théorique du self-memory system de Conway (2005) et nous amène à proposer que l’affaiblissement général des caractéristiques subjectives des souvenirs autobiographiques observé chez les patients refléterait une altération de la composante expérientielle du self et de la continuité temporelle du self. La composante conceptuelle du self qui regroupe les images de soi et les croyances apparaît également affaiblie. Enfin, l’organisation des souvenirs autobiographiques, le lien entre le self et les souvenirs ainsi que l’intégration des souvenirs au sein du self apparaissent diminués chez les patients.

D. Berntsen and D. C. Rubin,2006,Emotion and vantage point in autobiographical memory,"Autobiographical memories may be recalled from two different perspectives: Field memories in which the person seems to remember the scene from his/her original point of view and observer memories in which the rememberer sees him/herself in the memory image. Here, 122 undergraduates participated in an experiment examining the relation between field vs. observer perspective in memory for 10 different emotional states, including both positive and negative emotions and emotions associated with high vs. low intensity. Observer perspective was associated with reduced sensory and emotional reliving across all emotions. This effect was observed for naturally occurring memory perspective and when participants were instructed to change their perspective from field to observer, but not when participants were instructed to change perspective from observer to field.

Both groups answered a questionnaire addressing the recollective quality, integration and coherence of the traumatic memory that currently affected them most. Participants with a PTSD symptom profile reported more vivid recollection of emotion and sensory impressions. They reported more observer perspective in the memory (seeing themselves 'from the outside'), but no more fragmentation. They also agreed more with the statement that the trauma had become part of their identity, and perceived more thematic connections between the trauma and current events in their lives. The two groups showed different patterns of correlations which indicated different coping styles. Overall, the findings suggest that traumas form dysfunctional reference points for the organization of other personal memories in people with PTSD symptoms, leading to fluctuations between vivid intrusions and avoidance.

In this model, the activity of place cells constrain the contents of imagery and retrieval to be coherent and consistent with the subject occupying a single location, while the activity of head-direction cells along Papez’s circuit determine the viewpoint direction for which the egocentric image is generated. An extension of this model is discussed in which a role for grid cells in dynamic updating of representations (mental navigation) is included. We also discuss the extension of this model to implement a version of the dual representation theory of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in which PTSD arises from an imbalance between weak allocentric hippocampal-mediated contextual representations and strong affective/sensory representations.

Performance of these clinical groups was compared with age-matched controls, patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and patients with subjective memory impairments. We investigated the perception (concurrent match-to-sample) and short-term retention (2-s delayed match-to-sample) of the configuration of topographical features in computer-generated landscapes shown from different viewpoints. Thirty-one patients were tested (7 AD, 6 a-MCI, 7 temporal variant FTLD, 5 frontal variant FTLD, 6 subjective memory impairment) and 25 age- and gender-matched controls. Brain MRI was available for 27 patients; medial temporal lobe atrophy was assessed using a visual rating scale. Patients with a-MCI or mild AD were impaired on topographical short-term memory, but not perception. No other group differences were found on the topographical subtests. Notably, patients with temporal variants of FTLD performed normally, regardless of the laterality of damage. Subtests for the perception and retention of nonspatial aspects of the landscapes (weather conditions, seasonal and daily variations in lighting and color) were poor at differentiating the patient groups. These results indicate a core deficit in representing topographical layout, even for very short durations, within the context of more general long-term memory impairments found in AD, and suggest that this function is particularly sensitive to the earliest stages of the disease.",Hippocampus,20,10,1154-1169,10.1002/hipo.20715
"J. A. Bisby, J. A. King, C. R. Brewin, N. Burgess and H. V. Curran",2010,Acute Effects of Alcohol on Intrusive Memory Development and Viewpoint Dependence in Spatial Memory Support a Dual Representation Model,"BACKGROUND: A dual representation model of intrusive memory proposes that personally experienced events give rise to two types of representation: an image-based, egocentric representation based on sensory-perceptual features; and a more abstract, allocentric representation that incorporates spatiotemporal context. The model proposes that intrusions reflect involuntary reactivation of egocentric representations in the absence of a corresponding allocentric representation. We tested the model by investigating the effect of alcohol on intrusive memories and, concurrently, on egocentric and allocentric spatial memory. METHODS: With a double-blind independent group design participants were administered alcohol (.4 or .8 g/kg) or placebo. A virtual environment was used to present objects and test recognition memory from the same viewpoint as presentation (tapping egocentric memory) or a shifted viewpoint (tapping allocentric memory). Participants were also exposed to a trauma video and required to detail intrusive memories for 7 days, after which explicit memory was assessed. RESULTS: There was a selective impairment of shifted-view recognition after the low dose of alcohol, whereas the high dose induced a global impairment in same-view and shifted-view conditions. Alcohol showed a dose-dependent inverted U-shaped effect on intrusions, with only the low dose increasing the number of intrusions, replicating previous work. When same-view recognition was intact, decrements in shifted-view recognition were associated with increases in intrusions. CONCLUSIONS: The differential effect of alcohol on intrusive memories and on same/shifted-view recognition support a dual representation model in which intrusions might reflect an imbalance between two types of memory representation. These findings highlight important clinical implications, given alcohol's involvement in real-life trauma.",Biological Psychiatry,68,3,280-286,10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.01.010

Integral characteristics of the personalities of patients with successful and unsuccessful social and working adaptation are described. It was found that the successful adaptation of patients was based on value orientations characterized by a general compensatory direction at adequately evaluated personal and social difficulties with a high degree of observing social norms. As the adaptation becomes less and less successful, the part of adequate evaluations and relations determining the patient's self-estimation diminishes, the role of egocentric tendencies and purposes, and primitive requirements gets greater.

D. Boussaoud and S. P. Wise,1993,Primate frontal cortex: neuronal activity following attentional versus intentional cues,"We examined neuronal activity in three parts of the primate frontal cortex: the dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) premotor cortex and a ventrolateral part of the dorsolateral prefrontal (PF) cortex. Two monkeys fixated a 0.2 degrees white square in the center of a video display while depressing a switch located between two touch pads. On each trial, a spatial-attentional/mnemonic (SAM) cue was presented first. The SAM cue consisted of one 2 degrees x 2 degrees square, usually red or green, and its location indicated where a conditional motor instruction would appear after a delay period. The stimulus event containing the motor instruction, termed the motor instructional/conditional (MIC) cue, could be of two general types. It might consist of a single 2 degrees x 2 degrees square stimulus identical to one of the SAM cues presented at the same location as the SAM cue on that trial. When the MIC cue was a single square, it instructed the monkey to move its forelimb to one of the two touch pads according to the following conditional rule: a green MIC cue meant that contact with the right touch pad would be rewarded on that trial and a red MIC cue instructed a movement to the left touch pad. Alternatively, the MIC cue might consist of two 2 degrees x 2 degrees squares, only one of which was at the SAM-cue location: in those cases, one square was red and the other was green. The colored square at the SAM cue location for that trial was the instructing stimulus, and the other part of the MIC cue was irrelevant. When, after a variable delay period, the MIC cue disappeared, the monkey had to touch the appropriate target within 1 s to receive a reward and could break visual fixation. The experimental design allowed comparison of frontal cortical activity when one stimulus, identical in retinocentric, craniocentric, and allocentric spatial location as well as all other stimulus parameters, had two different meanings for the animal's behavior. When a stimulus was the SAM cue, it led to either a reorientation of spatial attention to its location, or the storage of its location in spatial memory. By contrast, when it was the MIC cue, the same stimulus instructed a motor act to be executed after a delay period. For the majority of PMd neurons (55%), post-MIC cue activity exceeded post-SAM cue activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Exp Brain Res,95,1,15-27,

The explanatory factor analyses performed for each memory type demonstrated the consistency of the AMCQ factor structure across all memory types; while a confirmatory factor analysis on the data garnered from all three studies supported the constructs for the autobiographical memory characteristics defined by the researchers. The AMCQ consists of 63 items and 14 factors, and the internal consistency values of all 14 scales were ranged between .66 and .97. The relationships between the AMCQ scales related to gender and individual emotions, as well as the intercorrelations among the scales, were consistent with both theoretical expectations and previous findings.

"H. J. Broadbent, E. K. Farran and A.

Recently, research has shown that spatial difficulties in WS extend to large-scale space, particularly in coding space using an allocentric frame of reference. Typically developing (TD) children and adults predominantly rely on the use of a sequential egocentric strategy to navigate a large-scale route (retracing a sequence of left-right body turns). The aim of this study was to examine whether individuals with WS are able to employ a sequential egocentric strategy to guide learning and the retracing of a route. Forty-eight TD children, aged 5, 7, and 9 years and 18 participants with WS were examined on their ability to learn and retrace routes in two (6-turn) virtual environment mazes (with and without landmarks). The ability to successfully retrace a route following the removal of landmarks (use of sequential egocentric coding) was also examined. Although in line with TD 5-year-olds when learning a route with landmarks, individuals with WS showed significantly greater detriment when these landmarks were removed, relative to all TD groups. Moreover, the WS group made significantly more errors than all TD groups when learning a route that never contained landmarks. On a perceptual view-matching task, results revealed a high level of performance across groups, indicative of an ability to use this visual information to potentially aid navigation. These findings suggest that individuals with WS rely on landmarks to a greater extent than TD children, both for learning a route and for retracing a recently learned route. TD children, but not individuals with WS, were able to fall back on the use of a sequential egocentric strategy to navigate when landmarks were not present. Only TD children therefore coded sequential route information simultaneously with landmark information. The results are discussed in relation to known atypical cortical development and perceptual-matching abilities in WS.",Frontiers in Psychology,6,,216,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00216

A double dissociation was found: the performance of patients with AD was found to be significantly impaired on tasks involving extrapersonal perception and construction but not on the test of egocentric space. In contrast, visuoconstructive performance by patients with HD was not significantly impaired, while salient deficits were apparent when manipulation of personal space was required.

"T. I. Brown, R. S. Ross, J. B. Keller, M. E. Hasselmo and C. E. Stern",2010,Which way was I going? Contextual retrieval supports the disambiguation of well learned overlapping navigational routes,"Groundbreaking research in animals has demonstrated that the hippocampus contains neurons that distinguish between overlapping navigational trajectories. These hippocampal neurons respond selectively to the context of specific episodes despite interference from overlapping memory representations. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to examine the role of the hippocampus and related structures when participants need to retrieve contextual information to navigate well learned spatial sequences that share common elements. Participants were trained outside the scanner to navigate through 12 virtual mazes from a ground-level first-person perspective. Six of the 12 mazes shared overlapping components. Overlapping mazes began and ended at distinct locations, but converged in the middle to share some hallways with another maze. Non-overlapping mazes did not share any hallways with any other maze. Successful navigation through the overlapping hallways required the retrieval of contextual information relevant to the current navigational episode. Results revealed greater activation during the successful navigation of the overlapping mazes compared with the non-overlapping mazes in regions typically associated with spatial and episodic memory, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.

"T. I. Brown, R. S. Ross, S. M. Tobyne and C. E. Stern",2012,Cooperative interactions between hippocampal and striatal systems support flexible navigation,"Research in animals and humans has demonstrated that the hippocampus is critical for retrieving distinct representations of overlapping sequences of information. There is recent evidence that the caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex are also involved in disambiguation of overlapping spatial representations. The hippocampus and caudate are functionally distinct regions, but both have anatomical links with the orbitofrontal cortex. The present study used an fMRI-based functional connectivity analysis in humans to examine the functional relationship between the hippocampus, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex when participants use contextual information to navigate well-learned spatial routes which share common elements. Participants were trained outside the scanner to navigate virtual mazes from a first-person perspective. Overlapping condition mazes began and ended at distinct locations, but converged in the middle to share some hallways with another maze. Non-overlapping condition mazes did not share any hallways with any other maze. Successful navigation through the overlapping hallways required contextual information identifying the current navigational route to guide the appropriate response for a given trial. Results revealed greater functional connectivity between the hippocampus, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex for overlapping mazes compared to non-overlapping mazes. The current findings suggest that the hippocampus and caudate interact with prefrontal structures cooperatively for successful contextually dependent navigation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We have focused on the employment of allocentric (i.e., encoding interrelationships among environmental cues, movements, and the location of the goal) and sequential egocentric (i.e., sequences of body turns associated with specific choice points) strategies during navigation. To investigate the developmental pattern of these two strategies in school-aged children, we used a virtual reality paradigm in which the spontaneous or imposed use of both strategies could be assessed. Our results showed an increase in spontaneous use of the allocentric strategy and also an increase in reliance on environmental landmarks with age. Although a majority of the children spontaneously used the sequential egocentric strategy, all age groups performed above chance when the allocentric strategy was imposed. Altogether, our findings suggest that young children are able to employ an allocentric strategy but that the nature of this allocentric strategy changes progressively in a complex cognitive representation between 5 and 10 years of age.",Journal of Experimental Child Psychology,107,3,337-350,10.1016/j.jecp.2010.05.010
N. Burgess,2008,Spatial cognition and the brain,"Recent advances in the understanding of spatial cognition are reviewed, focusing on memory for locations in large-scale space and on those advances inspired by single-unit recording and lesion studies in animals. Spatial memory appears to be supported by multiple parallel representations, including egocentric and allocentric representations, and those updated to accommodate self-motion. The effects of these representations can be dissociated behaviorally, developmentally, and in terms of their neural bases. It is now becoming possible to construct a mechanistic neural-level model of at least some aspects of spatial memory and imagery, with the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe providing allocentric environmental representations, the parietal lobe egocentric representations, and the retrosplenial cortex and parieto-occipital sulcus allowing both types of representation to interact. Insights from this model include a common mechanism for the construction of spatial scenes in the service of both imagery and episodic retrieval and a role for the remainder of Papez's circuit in orienting the viewpoint used. In addition, it appears that hippocampal and striatal systems process different aspects of environmental layout (boundaries and local landmarks, respectively) and do so using different learning rules (incidental learning and associative reinforcement, respectively).",Ann N Y Acad Sci,1124,,77-97,10.1196/annals.1440.002

These ideas are reviewed and related to several general aspects of episodic memory, including the differences between episodic, recognition and semantic memory, and whether hippocampal lesions differentially affect recent or remote memories. Some outstanding questions remain, such as: what characterizes episodic retrieval as opposed to other forms of read-out from memory; what triggers the storage of an event memory; and what are the neural mechanisms involved? To address these questions a neural-level model of the medial temporal and parietal roles in retrieval of the spatial context of an event is presented. This model combines the idea that retrieval of the rich context of real-life events is a central characteristic of episodic memory, and the idea that medial temporal allocentric representations are used in long-term storage while parietal egocentric representations are used to imagine, manipulate and re-experience the products of retrieval. The model is consistent with the known neural representation of spatial information in the brain, and provides an explanation for the involvement of Papez's circuit in both the representation of heading direction and in the recollection of episodic information. Two experiments relating to the model are briefly described. A functional neuroimaging study of memory for the spatial context of life-like events in virtual reality provides support for the model's functional localization. A neuropsychological experiment suggests that the hippocampus does store an allocentric representation of spatial locations.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Subjects received a set of objects from two different people in two different places within a VR environment. Memory for the objects, and for where and from whom they were received was tested by putting the subject back into a place in the company of a person and giving a paired forced choice of objects. In four conditions objects had to be chosen according to different criteria: which was received in that place, which was received from that person, which object was recognized, and which object was widest. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during testing to identify areas involved in retrieval of the spatial context of an event. A network of areas was identified consisting of a temporoparietal pathway running between the precuneus and parahippocampi via retrosplenial cortex and the parieto-occipital sulcus, left hippocampus, bilateral posterior parietal, dorsolateral, ventrolateral and anterior prefrontal cortices, and the anterior cingulate. Of these areas the parahippocampal, right posterior parietal, and posteriodorsal medial parietal areas were specifically involved in retrieval of spatial context compared to retrieval of nonspatial context. The posterior activations are consistent with a model of long-term storage of allocentric representations in medial temporal regions with translation to body-centered and head-centered representations computed in right posterior parietal cortex and buffered in the temporoparietal pathway so as to provide an imageable representation in the precuneus. Prefrontal activations are consistent with strategic retrieval processes, including those required to overcome the interference between the highly similar events.",Neuroimage,14,2,439-453,10.1006/nimg.2001.0806

Her verbal memory and her recognition memory for unknown buildings, landmarks and outdoor scenes was intact, although she showed an impairment in face processing. By contrast, her navigational ability, quantitatively assessed within a small virtual reality (VR) town, was significantly impaired. Interestingly, she showed a selective impairment in a VR object-location memory test whenever her viewpoint was shifted between presentation and test, but not when tested from the same viewpoint. We suggest that a specific impairment in locating objects relative to the environment rather than relative to the perceived viewpoint (i.e. allocentric rather than egocentric spatial memory) underlies her topographical disorientation. We discuss the likely neural bases of this deficit in the light of related studies in humans and animals, focusing on the hippocampus and related areas.

We argued that the temporal element within spatiotemporal should be the order/simultaneity of the event elements, but that it is not clear whether the spatial content should be egocentric or allocentric. We also argued that episodic recollection should be configural (tending towards all-or-nothing recall of the WWW elements). Our first deferred imitation experiment, using a two-dimensional (2D) display, produced superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but no evidence of configural memory. Moreover, performance did not differ from that on a What-What-What control task. Our second deferred imitation study required the children to reproduce actions on an object in a room, thereby affording layout-based spatial cues. In this case, not only was there superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but memory was also configural at both ages. We discuss the importance of allocentric spatial cues in episodic recall in early proto-episodic memory and reflect on the possible role of hippocampal development in this process.","Memory (Hove, England)",23,8,1172-1192,10.1080/09658211.2014.963625

For example, whereas FNX lesions impaired allocentric spatial delayed alternation in a T-maze but generally spared a test of spontaneous object recognition, PPRH lesions produced the opposite pattern of results. Indeed, on the T-maze task PPRH Ss significantly outperformed controls when the retention delay was increased to 60 sec. In addition, some evidence was found that contributions from both the FNX and PPRH may be required when object and spatial information must be integrated. In an object-in-place test, for example, PPRH Ss failed according to 2 measures, and FNX animals failed according to 1 measure, to discriminate objects that had remained in fixed locations from those that had exchanged locations with other objects. It is suggested that the PPRH, rather than being specialized for a particular type of associative learning, is important for processing complex visual stimuli.

For this reason, the involvement of the hippocampus in event memory is thought to depend on its connections with these cortical areas. 15 male rats served as Ss in this experiment. Contrary to these predictions, the authors found that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced lesions of the putative rat homologs of these cortical areas (perirhinal plus postrhinal cortices) did not impair performance on 2 allocentric spatial tasks highly sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction. Remarkably, for one of the tasks there was evidence of a facilitation of performance. The same cortical lesions did, however, disrupt spontaneous object recognition and object discrimination reversal learning but spared initial acquisition of the discrimination. This pattern of results reveals important dissociations between different aspects of memory within the temporal lobe. Furthermore, it shows that the perirhinal-postrhinal cortex is not a necessary route for spatial information reaching the hippocampus and that object familiarity–novelty detection depends on different neural substrates than do other aspects of event memory.

Furthermore, the precuneus and surrounding structures within the posteromedial parietal region are thought to represent a crucial node in the 'default mode' system, a network of brain structures displaying high resting metabolic rate and transient deactivations during engagement in non self-referential tasks. Therefore, it has recently been proposed that the precuneus plays a pivotal role in the neural correlates of consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of pathophysiological states characterised by altered consciousness, such as sleep, vegetative state, and pharmacological anaesthesia.

This cortical area has traditionally received little attention, mainly because of its hidden location and the virtual absence of focal lesion studies. However, recent functional imaging findings in healthy subjects suggest a central role for the precuneus in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval and self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. Furthermore, precuneus and surrounding posteromedial areas are amongst the brain structures displaying the highest resting metabolic rates (hot spots) and are characterized by transient decreases in the tonic activity during engagement in non-self-referential goal-directed actions (default mode of brain function). Therefore, it has recently been proposed that precuneus is involved in the interwoven network of the neural correlates of self-consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of altered conscious states, such as sleep, drug-induced anaesthesia and vegetative states. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of precuneus, together with its wide-spread connectivity with both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by connectional and neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, and links these notions with the multifaceted spectrum of its behavioural correlates. By means of a critical analysis of precuneus activation patterns in response to different mental tasks, this paper provides a useful conceptual framework for matching the functional imaging findings with the specific role(s) played by this structure in the higher-order cognitive functions in which it has been implicated. Specifically, activation patterns appear to converge with anatomical and connectivity data in providing preliminary evidence for a functional subdivision within the precuneus into an anterior region, involved in self-centred mental imagery strategies, and a posterior region, subserving successful episodic memory retrieval.

M. Cerles and S. Rousset,2012,Bias in self-motion perceived speed can enhance episodic memory,"Prior experiences of a stimulus facilitate reprocessing of that stimulus on a subsequent occasion. This relative ease and speed with which information is processed is defined as fluency and can constitute a basis for memory judgment. Fluency can also be manipulated on line by perceptual bias (e.g., levels of noise), leading to an increase in recognition for items processed more fluently (e.g., items with less noise). Previous experiments using Remember-Know paradigm have shown an impact of perceptual fluency only on familiarity and not on recollection. Recent episodic memory models have postulated a strong link between episodic memory and spatial processes, especially with egocentric updating (Gomez et al. in Acta Psychol 132(3):221-227, 2009). The present experiment was conducted to determine whether self-motion fluency affects recognition performance and particularly has an impact on Remember responses. Thirty participants learned a 4-min path movie and then had to recognize among short paths if they were part of the learned path, followed by a Remember-Know procedure for recognized items. Self-motion fluency was manipulated with the presence of nimble acceleration applied on a small part of the recognition paths. Results show that the presence of a self-motion fluency increases significantly the proportion of remember responses solely on learned paths. This study spotlights for the first time a specific fluency effect on recollection and indicates an implication of egocentric-updating processing in episodic memory retrieval.",Cognitive processing,13 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,S121-S124,

Allocentric spatial memory is assessed by altering the viewpoint, colors and textures between the initially presented and target images. Allocentric spatial memory is a key function of the hippocampus, one of the earliest brain regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and impairment of hippocampal function predates the onset of dementia. It was hypothesized that performance on the 4MT would aid the diagnosis of predementia AD, which manifests clinically as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The 4MT was applied to patients with MCI, stratified further based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker status (10 MCI biomarker positive, 9 MCI biomarker negative), and with mild AD dementia, as well as healthy controls. Comparator tests included tests of episodic memory and attention widely accepted as sensitive measures of early AD. Behavioral data were correlated with quantitative MRI measures of the hippocampus, precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus. 4MT scores were significantly different between the two MCI groups (p = 0.001), with a test score of ≤8/15 associated with 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity for the classification of MCI with positive AD biomarkers, i.e., predementia AD. 4MT test scores correlated with hippocampal volume (r = 0.42) and cortical thickness of the precuneus (r = 0.55). In conclusion, the 4MT is effective in identifying the early stages of AD.

We have previously shown a similar behavioral dissociation in nonhuman primates. Hippocampal lesion in adult monkeys prevents allocentric spatial relational learning, whereas spatial learning persists following neonatal lesion. Here, we quantified the number of cells expressing the immediate-early gene c-fos, a marker of neuronal activity, to characterize the functional organization of the medial temporal lobe memory system following neonatal hippocampal lesion. Ninety minutes before brain collection, three control and four adult monkeys with bilateral neonatal hippocampal lesions explored a novel environment to activate brain structures involved in spatial learning. Three other adult monkeys with neonatal hippocampal lesions remained in their housing quarters. In unlesioned monkeys, we found high levels of c-fos expression in the intermediate and caudal regions of the entorhinal cortex, and in the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and retrosplenial cortices. In lesioned monkeys, spatial exploration induced an increase in c-fos expression in the intermediate field of the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and retrosplenial cortices, but not in the caudal entorhinal cortex. These findings suggest that different regions of the medial temporal lobe memory system may require different types of interaction with the hippocampus in support of memory. The caudal perirhinal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex, and the retrosplenial cortex may contribute to spatial learning in the absence of functional hippocampal circuits, whereas the caudal entorhinal cortex may require hippocampal output to support spatial learning.",Brain structure & function,222,9,3899-3914,10.1007/s00429-017-1441-z

In comparison to egocentric mechanisms, very little is known about such a landmark-centered representation. Here, we used an event-related fMRI design to identify brain areas supporting these two types of spatial coding (i.e., landmark-centered vs. gaze-centered) for target memory during the Delay phase where only target location, not saccade direction, was specified. The paradigm included three tasks with identical display of visual stimuli but different auditory instructions: Landmark Saccade (remember target location relative to a visual landmark, independent of gaze), Control Saccade (remember original target location relative to gaze fixation, independent of the landmark), and a non-spatial control, Color Report (report target color). During the Delay phase, the Control and Landmark Saccade tasks activated overlapping areas in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and frontal cortex as compared to the color control, but with higher activation in PPC for target coding in the Control Saccade task and higher activation in temporal and occipital cortex for target coding in Landmark Saccade task. Gaze-centered directional selectivity was observed in superior occipital gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus, whereas landmark-centered directional selectivity was observed in precuneus and midposterior intraparietal sulcus. During the Response phase after saccade direction was specified, the parietofrontal network in the left hemisphere showed higher activation for rightward than leftward saccades. Our results suggest that cortical activation for coding saccade target direction relative to a visual landmark differs from gaze-centered directional selectivity for target memory, from the mechanisms for other types of allocentric tasks, and from the directionally selective mechanisms for saccade planning and execution.",Front Syst Neurosci,11,,44,10.3389/fnsys.2017.00044

Here, we used an event-related fMRI design to distinguish human brain areas involved in these two types of representation. Our paradigm consisted of three tasks with identical stimulus display but different instructions: egocentric reach (remember absolute target location), allocentric reach (remember target location relative to a visual landmark), and a nonspatial control, color report (report color of target). During the delay phase (when only target location was specified), the egocentric and allocentric tasks elicited widely overlapping regions of cortical activity (relative to the control), but with higher activation in parietofrontal cortex for egocentric task and higher activation in early visual cortex for allocentric tasks. In addition, egocentric directional selectivity (target relative to gaze) was observed in the superior occipital gyrus and the inferior occipital gyrus, whereas allocentric directional selectivity (target relative to a visual landmark) was observed in the inferior temporal gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. During the response phase (after movement direction had been specified either by reappearance of the visual landmark or a pro-/anti-reach instruction), the parietofrontal network resumed egocentric directional selectivity, showing higher activation for contralateral than ipsilateral reaches. These results show that allocentric and egocentric reach mechanisms use partially overlapping but different cortical substrates and that directional specification is different for target memory versus reach response.",J Neurosci,34,37,12515-12526,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1445-14.2014

Here, we investigated this using a slow event-related fMRI paradigm, based on our previous behavioural finding that the allocentric-to-egocentric (Allo-Ego) conversion for reach is performed at the first possible opportunity. Participants were asked to remember (and eventually reach towards) the location of a briefly presented target relative to another visual landmark. After a first memory delay, participants were forewarned by a verbal instruction if the landmark would reappear at the same location (potentially allowing them to plan a reach following the auditory cue before the second delay), or at a different location where they had to wait for the final landmark to be presented before response, and then reach towards the remembered target location. As predicted, participants showed landmark-centred directional selectivity in occipital-temporal cortex during the first memory delay, and only developed egocentric directional selectivity in occipital-parietal cortex during the second delay for the 'Same cue' task, and during response for the 'Different cue' task. We then compared cortical activation between these two tasks at the times when the Allo-Ego conversion occurred, and found common activation in right precuneus, right presupplementary area and bilateral dorsal premotor cortex. These results confirm that the brain converts allocentric codes to egocentric plans at the first possible opportunity, and identify the four most likely candidate sites specific to the Allo-Ego transformation for reaches.",Eur J Neurosci,47,8,901-917,10.1111/ejn.13885

Here, we review this literature, focusing on the contributions of hippocampal and striatal systems, and attempt to outline a minimal cognitive architecture that is consistent with the experimental literature and that synthesizes previous related computational modeling. The resulting architecture includes striatal reinforcement learning based on egocentric representations of sensory states and actions, incidental Hebbian association of sensory information with allocentric state representations in the hippocampus, and arbitration of the outputs of both systems based on confidence/uncertainty in medial prefrontal cortex. We discuss the relationship between this architecture and learning in model-free and model-based systems, episodic memory, imagery, and planning, including some open questions and directions for further experiments.",Neuron,88,1,64-77,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.09.021
"C. Chu, J. M. Buchman-Schmitt and T. E. Joiner",2015,Autobiographical memory perspectives in task and suicide attempt recall: A study of young adults with and without symptoms of suicidality,"Memories recalled from the field, or first person, perspective tend to be specific, more detail-oriented, and emotional. In contrast, memories from the observer, or third person, perspective, tend to be more general, less detail-oriented and emotional. Research suggests that individuals with a history of suicidality exhibit over-general autobiographical memories (i.e., lacking in detail). We propose that individuals with a history of suicidality may encode and recall memories more from the observer perspective, which is associated with recalling fewer details about events. This hypothesis was tested by examining the memory perspectives of 107 young adults with and without symptoms of suicidality during task and event recall. Compared to controls, suicide attempters recalled tasks and neutral events significantly less from the observer perspective and more from the field perspective; suicide ideators and controls were not significantly different on recall perspectives. No significant differences in negative event and suicide attempt recall were found across groups. Results indicated that suicide attempters exhibited a recall bias towards first person, internally focused memories. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

"E. Ciaramelli, R. S. Rosenbaum, S. Solcz, B. Levine and M. Moscovitch",2010,Mental space travel: Damage to posterior parietal cortex prevents egocentric navigation and reexperiencing of remote spatial memories,"The ability to navigate in a familiar environment depends on both an intact mental representation of allocentric spatial information and the integrity of systems supporting complementary egocentric representations. Although the hippocampus has been implicated in learning new allocentric spatial information, converging evidence suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) might support egocentric representations. To date, however, few studies have examined long-standing egocentric representations of environments learned long ago. Here we tested 7 patients with focal lesions in PPC and 12 normal controls in remote spatial memory tasks, including 2 tasks reportedly reliant on allocentric representations (distance and proximity judgments) and 2 tasks reportedly reliant on egocentric representations (landmark sequencing and route navigation; see Rosenbaum, Ziegler, Winocur, Grady, & Moscovitch, 2004). Patients were unimpaired in distance and proximity judgments. In contrast, they all failed in route navigation, and left-lesioned patients also showed marginally impaired performance in landmark sequencing. Patients' subjective experience associated with navigation was impoverished and disembodied compared with that of the controls. These results suggest that PPC is crucial for accessing remote spatial memories within an egocentric reference frame that enables both navigation and reexperiencing. Additionally, PPC was found to be necessary to implement specific aspects of allocentric navigation with high demands on spontaneous retrieval.

This ability requires that a circadian clock provide phase information (a time tag) to cognitive systems involved in linking representations of an event with spatial reference memory. To date, it is unclear which neuronal substrates are critical in this process, but one candidate structure is the hippocampus (HPC). The HPC is essential for normal performance on tasks that require allocentric spatial memory and exhibits circadian rhythms of gene expression that are sensitive to meal timing. Using a novel TPL training procedure and enriched, multidimensional environment, we trained rats to locate a food reward that varied between two locations relative to time of day. After rats acquired the task, they received either HPC or SHAM lesions and were re-tested. Rats with HPC lesions were initially impaired on the task relative to SHAM rats, but re-attained high scores with continued testing. Probe tests revealed that the rats were not using an alternation strategy or relying on light-dark transitions to locate the food reward. We hypothesize that transient disruption and recovery reflect a switch from HPC-dependent allocentric navigation (learning places) to dorsal striatum-dependent egocentric spatial navigation (learning routes to a location). Whatever the navigation strategy, these results demonstrate that the HPC is not required for rats to find food in different locations using circadian phase as a discriminative cue.",Neurobiol Learn Mem,136,,236-243,10.1016/j.nlm.2016.09.004

In particular, the study focuses on the distinction between different spatial representations, by using a paradigm in which participants are asked to relocate objects explored haptically. Three frames of reference were systematically compared. In experiment 1, participants relocated the objects either from the same position of learning by taking as reference their own body (centred egocentric condition) or from a 90 degrees decentred position (allocentric condition). Performance was measured in terms of linear distance errors and angular distance errors. Results revealed that the allocentric condition was more difficult than the centred egocentric condition. In experiment 2, participants performed either the centred egocentric condition or a decentred egocentric condition, in which the body position during the test was the same as at encoding (egocentric) but the frame of reference was based on a point decentred by 90 degrees. The decentred egocentric condition was found to be more difficult than the centred egocentric condition. Finally, in experiment 3, participants performed in the decentred egocentric condition or the allocentric condition. Here, the allocentric condition was found to be more difficult than the decentred egocentric condition. Taken together, the results suggest that also in the peripersonal space and in the absence of vision different frames of reference can be distinguished. In particular, the decentred egocentric condition involves a frame of reference which seems to be neither allocentric nor totally egocentric.",Perception,36,6,850-864,10.1068/p5621

In the striking neurological syndrome called representational or imaginal neglect, patients with right brain damage fail to report contralesional, left-sided elements of familiar places relative to their imaginary vantage point. Notwithstanding descriptions of single cases of representational neglect dissociated from perceptual or visual neglect, it is still unknown whether this disorder is due to specific brain lesions. Here we show that the ability to properly recall and inspect places from memory is supported by a neural network dissociated from that necessary to properly scan single objects from memory or the external visual world. Lesion-symptoms mapping of 40 right-damaged patients with and without imaginal neglect identified a peak region located at the posterior junction between the parietal and temporal lobes (pTPJ), where the angular and supramarginal gyri abut on the posterior temporal cortex. This region is known to support first-person perspective transformations and is connected with systems relevant for navigation and retrieval from autobiographical memory.

Despite evidence of a relation between prospection and episodic memory, there is a paucity of research comparing the developmental trajectories of each during middle childhood, a time of substantial episodic memory development. This study examined prospection and episodic memory in 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old children and adults (N =80). Participants provided narratives and introspective judgments about their experience of mentalizing past and future events. The development of prospection was more protracted than that of episodic memory, although individual differences in past event episodicity predicted prospection. Although both prospection and episodic memory were characterized by a rich subjective experience, future events were rated as more difficult to envision and were more frequently viewed in the third-person perspective. Although both prospection and episodic memory appear to improve during middle childhood, results suggest that prospection may require additional skills.

R. A. Crawley,2010,Closure of autobiographical memories: The effects of written recounting from first- or third-person visual perspective,"Autobiographical memories are recalled with varying degrees of psychological closure. Closure is a subjective assessment of how far a remembered experience feels resolved, and it has been suggested that one predictor of closure is the amount of emotional detail in the memory. Study 1 examined which aspect of emotional detail is important for closure, and showed that open and closed negative memories were distinguished by ratings of emotion evoked during recall, not by remembered emotion from the time of the event. The recall of open memories was accompanied by more intense, more negative, and less positive emotion than the recall of closed memories. Biased retelling of memories has been shown to influence closure and on the basis of evidence that third-person recall serves a distancing function, Study 2 examined whether instructions to repeatedly recount an open memory from a third-person perspective would increase closure compared with a single or repeated recounting from a first-person perspective. While repeated third-person recounting had the greatest influence on closure, there were also increases in the first-person recounting groups. The results suggest that closure can be increased by reporting memories in written narrative form, particularly if repeatedly expressed from the third-person perspective.","Memory (Hove, England)",18,8,900-917,10.1080/09658211.2010.524650

We hypothesized that the more important a trait descriptor was, the more likely participants would be to misremember it as having been presented in a self-referential manner. This hypothesis was tested using a source-memory task; subjective ratings of importance served as predictors of accuracy. In two experiments, logistic multilevel analyses supported our predictions, indicating that people use cues of importance when deciding if stimuli are self-referential.

Studies using a variety of paradigms involving self-performed actions argue in favor of perspective taking confusion in hallucination-prone subjects. However, our understanding of such processes during adolescence is still at an early stage. The present study thus aims (1) to delineate the neural correlates sustaining mental simulation of actions involving self-performed actions (first-person perspective; 1PP) and other-performed actions (third-person perspective; 3PP) during adolescence (2) to identify atypical activation patterns during 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions in hallucination-prone adolescents (3) to examine whether differential risk for schizophrenia (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in the 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions during adolescence. Twenty-two typically developing controls (Control group; 6 females), 12 hallucination-prone adolescents [auditory hallucination (AH) group; 7 females] and 13 adolescents with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS group; 4 females) were included in the study. During the fMRI task, subjects were presented with a cue (self-other priming cues) indicating to perform the task using either a first person perspective (“you”-1PP) or a third person perspective (“best friend”-3PP) and then they were asked to mentally simulate actions based on the type of cue. Hallucination-proneness was assessed using a self-report questionnaire [Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS)]. Our results indicated that atypical patterns of cerebral activation, particularly in the key areas of self-other distinction, were found in both groups at risk for auditory hallucinations (AHs and 22q11.2DS). More precisely, adolescents in the AH group presented decreased activations in the right middle occipital gyrus BA19, left cingulate gyrus BA31, and right precuneus BA31 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. Adolescents in the 22q11.2DS group presented decreased activations in the right superior occipital gyrus BA19, left caudate tail and left precuneus BA7 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. In comparison to the Control group, only the 22q11.2DS adolescents showed a decreased activation for other-related cues (prime other > prime self contrast) in areas of visual imagery, episodic memory and social cognition. This study characterizes the neural correlates of mental imagery for actions during adolescence, and suggests that a differential risk for hallucination-proneness (clinical vs. genetic) is associated to similar patterns of atypical activations in key areas sustaining self-other discrimination processes. These observations may provide relevant information for future research and prevention strategies with regards to hallucination-proneness during adolescence.

The vividness of an episodic future thought largely depends on the familiarity of its constitutive elements (i.e., the envisioned location, persons and objects), while the visual perspective adopted is instead related to the temporal distance of the imagined event. Cognitive feelings such as the sense of pre-experiencing the future depend on sensory-perceptual qualities, and are further modulated by the personal importance attributed to the event. These findings suggest that the essence of episodic future thought-the sensation of mentally visiting one's personal future-lies, in part, in the relevance of imagined events with respect to personal goals.",Conscious Cogn,21,3,1198-1206,10.1016/j.concog.2012.05.004

A test of episodic-like memory for the rat, the What-Where-Which occasion task (WWWhich), requires the association of object, location, and contextual information to form an integrated memory for an event. The WWWhich task cannot be solved by use of non-episodic information such as object familiarity and is dependent on hippocampal integrity. Thus, it provides an ideal tool with which to test capacity for episodic-like memory in the 3xTg murine model for AD. As this model captures much of the human AD phenotype, we hypothesized that these mice would show a deficit in the WWWhich episodic-like memory task. To test the specificity of any episodic-like deficit, we also examined whether mice could perform components of the WWWhich task that do not require episodic-like memory. These included object (Novel Object Recognition), location (Object Location Task, What-Where task), and contextual (What-Which) memory, as well as another three-component task that can be solved without reliance on episodic recall (What-Where-When; WWWhen). The results demonstrate for the first time that control 129sv/c57bl6 mice could form WWWhich episodic-like memories, whereas, 3xTgAD mice at 6 months of age were impaired. Importantly, while 3xTgAD mice showed some deficit on spatial component tasks, they were unimpaired in the more complex WWWhen combination task (which includes a spatial component and is open to non-episodic solutions). These results strongly suggest that AD pathology centered on the hippocampal formation mediates a specific deficit for WWWhich episodic-like memory in the 3xTgAD model.",Journal of Alzheimers Disease,33,3,681-698,10.3233/Jad-2012-121543

However, some of the underlying functions of the MTL can be ascertained from its wider role in supporting spatial cognition in concert with parietal and prefrontal regions. The MTL is strongly implicated in the formation of enduring allocentric representations (e.g., O’Keefe, 1976; King et al., 2002; Ekstrom et al., 2003). According to our BBB model (Byrne et al., 2007), these representations must interact with head-centered and body-centered representations in posterior parietal cortex via a transformation circuit involving retrosplenial areas. Egocentric sensory representations in parietal areas can then cue the recall of allocentric spatial representations in long-term memory and, conversely, the products of retrieval in MTL can generate mental imagery within a parietal “window.” Such imagery is necessarily egocentric and forms part of visuospatial working memory, in which it can be manipulated for the purpose of planning/imagining the future. Recent fMRI evidence (Lambrey et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) supports the BBB model. To further test the model, we had participants learn the locations of objects in a virtual scene and tested their spatial memory under conditions that impose varying demands on the transformation circuit. We analyzed how brain activity correlated with accuracy in judging the direction of an object (1) from visuospatial working memory (we assume transient working memory due to the order of tasks and the absence of change in viewpoint, but long-term memory retrieval is also possible), (2) after a rotation of viewpoint, or (3) after a rotation and translation of viewpoint (judgment of relative direction). We found performance-related activity in both tasks requiring viewpoint rotation (ROT and JRD, i.e., conditions 2 and 3) in the core medial temporal to medial parietal circuit identified by the BBB model.

West",2017,Electrophysiological evidence for enhanced attentional deployment in spatial learners,"Visual spatial attention is important during navigation processes that rely on a cognitive map, because spatial relationships between environmental landmarks need to be selected, encoded, and learned. People who navigate using this strategy are spatial learners, and this process relies on the hippocampus. Conversely, response learners memorize a series of actions to navigate, which relies on the caudate nucleus. Response learning, which is more efficient, is thought to involve less demanding cognitive operations, and is related to reduced grey matter in the hippocampus. To test if navigational strategy can impact visual attention performance, we investigated if spatial and response learners showed differences in attentional engagement used during a visual spatial task. We tested 40 response learners and 39 spatial learners, as determined by the 4-on-8 Virtual Maze (4/8 VM), on a target detection task designed to elicit an N2pc component (an index visual spatial attention). Spatial learners produced a larger N2pc amplitude during target detection compared to response learners. This relationship might represent an increase in goal-directed attention towards target stimuli or a more global increase in cognitive function that has been previously observed in spatial learners.",Experimental Brain Research,235,5,1387-1395,10.1007/s00221-017-4884-9

Handy",2009,Neural systems mediating field and observer memories,"Autobiographical memories are more imbued with affect when one adopts a first-person or field perspective during event retrieval, rather than a third-person or observer perspective. We combined fMRI, event narratives, and subjective ratings to identify the neural networks engaged with field versus observer memories for real-world events. Our results revealed significant decreases in bilateral insula and left somato-motor activity during the recall of observer memories, paired with a small relative increase in right posterior amygdala activity coincident with the recall of field memories. Notably, these regions showed no overlap with those areas mediating the narrative content and subjective emotionality of the remembered events. Our findings suggest that the emotionality of field relative to observer memories is not simply driven by increased limbic activation when one adopts a first-person retrieval perspective. Rather, there is also a significant reduction in one's cortical representations of the physical, embodied self when a third-person—or disembodied—perspective is taken at retrieval.

Starrett",2017,Interacting networks of brain regions underlie human spatial navigation: a review and novel synthesis of the literature,"Navigation is an inherently dynamic and multimodal process, making isolation of the unique cognitive components underlying it challenging. The assumptions of much of the literature on human spatial navigation are that 1) spatial navigation involves modality independent, discrete metric representations (i.e., egocentric vs. allocentric), 2) such representations can be further distilled to elemental cognitive processes, and 3) these cognitive processes can be ascribed to unique brain regions. We argue that modality-independent spatial representations, instead of providing exact metrics about our surrounding environment, more often involve heuristics for estimating spatial topology useful to the current task at hand. We also argue that egocentric (body centered) and allocentric (world centered) representations are better conceptualized as involving a continuum rather than as discrete. We propose a neural model to accommodate these ideas, arguing that such representations also involve a continuum of network interactions centered on retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortex, respectively. Our model thus helps explain both behavioral and neural findings otherwise difficult to account for with classic models of spatial navigation and memory, providing a testable framework for novel experiments.",Journal of neurophysiology,118,6,3328-3344,10.1152/jn.00531.2017

Here, we consider key conceptual issues that have impeded progress in our understanding of hippocampal function, and we review findings that establish the scope and limits of hippocampal involvement in navigation and memory. We argue that space and time serve as a primary scaffold to break up experiences into specific contexts, and to organize multimodal input that is to be associated within a context. However, the hippocampus is clearly capable of incorporating additional dimensions into the scaffold if they are determined to be relevant in the event-defined context. Conceiving of the hippocampal representation as constrained by immediate task demands-yet preferring axes that involve space and time-helps to reconcile an otherwise disparate set of findings on the core function of the hippocampus.",Hippocampus,,,,
"D. Feyers, F. Collette, A. D'Argembeau, S. Majerus and E. Salmon",2010,Neural networks involved in self-judgement in young and elderly adults,"Recent studies have shown that both young and elderly subjects activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) when they make self-referential judgements. However, the VMPFC might interact with different brain regions during self-referencing in the two groups. In this study, based on data from Ruby et al. (2009), we have explored this issue using psychophysiological interaction analyses. Young and elderly participants had to judge adjectives describing personality traits in reference to the self versus a close friend or relative (the other), taking either a first-person or a third-person perspective. The physiological factor was the VMPFC activity observed in all participants during self-judgement, and the psychological factor was the self versus other referential process. The main effect of first-person perspective in both groups revealed that the VMPFC was co-activated with the left parahippocampal gyrus and the precuneus for self versus other judgments. The main effect of age showed a stronger correlation between activity in the VMPFC and the lingual gyrus in young compared to elderly subjects. Finally, in the interaction, the VMPFC was specifically co-activated with the orbitofrontal gyrus and the precentral gyrus when elderly subjects took a first-person perspective for self-judgements. No significant result was observed for the interaction in young subjects. These findings show that, although the VMPFC is engaged by both young and older adults when making self-referential judgements, this brain structure interacts differently with other brain regions as a function of age and perspective. These differences might reflect a tendency by older people to engage in more emotional/social processing than younger adults when making self-referential judgements with a first-person perspective.",Neuroimage,53,1,341-347,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.05.071
A. A.

This supposition is in contrast with current understanding that DMN activated when the subjects are resting and deactivated during any attention-demanding cognitive tasks. To test our proposal, we used, in retrospect, the results from our two early studies (Fingelkurts, 1998; Fingelkurts et al., 2003). In both studies for the majority of experimental trails we indeed found a constellation of operationally synchronized cortical areas (indexed as DMN) that was persistent across all studied experimental conditions in all subjects. Furthermore, we found three major elements comprising this DMN: two symmetrical occipito-parieto-temporal and one frontal spatio-temporal patterns. This new data directly supports the notion that DMN has a specific functional connotation - it provides neurophysiologic basis for self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency.

Applying the electroencephalogram (EEG) operational synchrony analysis to extract three modules of the self-referential brain network in 12 medication-free depressive outpatients and 10 control subjects we have found an increase in the strength of EEG synchrony within all three modules in depressive patients (though non-significant for the right module). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis that used 3 factors (values of synchrony strength for all three modules) as input indicated that combined increase in the strength of synchrony in all three modules was positively associated with severity of depression. Taken together the findings of this study suggest that depression is primarily associated with hypersynchrony in all three modules of the brain self-referential network (the anterior module been responsible for witnessing observation and first-person perspective, the left posterior module been responsible for reflective agency and narration and the right posterior module been responsible for bodily representational-emotional agency), thus contributing to excessive self-focus, rumination, and body tension.",Neuropsychologia,99,,30-36,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.02.020

Mental time travel (MTT) is the ability to mentally project oneself into one's personal past or future, in terms of memories of personal past events or projections of possible events in the personal future. MTT can be voluntarily initiated or occur involuntarily. The current exploratory study investigated involuntary and voluntary MTT in the context of trait worry, thereby bringing together research on worry and MTT. High (N=20) and low (N=16) worriers recorded involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memories and future projections using a structured diary method. We predicted that MTT in high worriers would show signs of cognitive avoidance, such as reduced emotional intensity, more observer perspective, less visual imagery, or coming up with overgeneral or less self-relevant events. We found only partial support for our hypotheses in that high worriers rated personal memories and future projections lower on measures of self-relevance than did low worriers.",Memory,19,6,625-640,10.1080/09658211.2011.595722

We examined this relation across a range of discrete emotions. In Study 1, we found that high worriers compared with low worriers use more observer perspective when remembering and imagining emotional (fear, joy, shame, pride), important, and word-cued events. Across emotional and word-cued events, and for both past and future temporal direction, high worriers reported more observer perspective than low worriers. In Study 2, we examined the use of visual perspective in relation to worry and other measures of negative affect and thinking styles, when remembering events involving positive versus negative evaluation of self versus others (shame, pride, contempt, admiration). We found that measures of general anxiety, symptoms of social anxiety, and rumination were associated with greater observer perspective, whereas reflection was associated with more field perspective. Together, the 2 studies show that high levels of maladaptive thinking and negative affect are associated with using more observer perspective when imagining and remembering autobiographical events across a range of emotions.

The results suggest that maladaptive RT is associated with increased emotional response to mentally travelling to negative events and with reduced specificity of past MTT. The results for sensory reliving and field-observer perspective were mixed. We discuss why maladaptive RT is associated with both increased emotional response and reduced specificity, which has been suggested to decrease emotional responses to MTT. We suggest that differences in the conceptualization of maladaptive RT and sampling clinical versus healthy participants may explain this apparently contradictory finding. Alternatively, maladaptive RT may be characterized by both increased emotional response to MTT and attempts at reducing the emotional response through reduced specificity. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",Nordic Psychology,65,2,137-165,

Translational research allowing comparison of similar memory properties between human and rodent models is a requirement for the finding of behavioral and cognitive biomarkers as well as molecular deficits associated to the pathology. In this review, we propose that the ability to remember an ordered sequence of choices during spatial navigation could be one of the episodic memory properties shared by human and rodent models. The ability to learn the correct sequence of choices depends on the hippocampus, requires flexibility and is particularly sensitive to age-related decline in rodents as in humans. In an innovative approach, we took advantage of a well characterized rodent navigation task, the starmaze, to develop a new model of episodic allowing creating and objective experimental testing of a personal past experience without requiring verbal report which can be transferred to human.",Behavioural Brain Research,215,2,172-179,10.1016/j.bbr.2010.05.054

Visual perspective during AM retrieval was assessed in two independent datasets of 45 and 20 healthy young adults with two different AM retrieval tasks.

The spontaneous tendency to recall memories from a first-person perspective was positively correlated with the right precuneus volume among the two independent datasets. Whole-brain analyses revealed that these results were relatively specific to the anterior part of the right precuneus.

To investigate the role of HF and PH neurons in environmental scaling in primates, we recorded neuronal activities in the monkey HF and PH during virtual navigation (VN) and pointer translocation (PT) tasks. The monkeys had to navigate within three differently sized virtual spaces with the same spatial cues (VN task) or move a pointer on a screen (PT task) by manipulating a joystick to receive a reward. Of the 234 recorded neurons, 170 and 61 neurons displayed place-related activities in the VN and PT tasks, respectively. Significant differences were observed between the HF and PH neurons. The spatial similarity of place fields between the two different virtual spaces was lower in PH than in HF, while specificities of the neuronal responses to distal spatial cues were higher in PH than in HF. Spatial view information was predominately processed in posterior PH. The spatial scales (place field sizes) of the HF and PH neurons were reduced in the reduced virtual space, as shown in rodent place cells.

While deficits in autobiographical memory are well-established in autism, few studies have focused on adolescence; a critical period for the developing self and self-esteem. Method: 16 adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 16 typically developing adolescent controls matched for IQ and gender, were asked to provide three self-defining and three everyday memories. Participants rated their memories for emotional intensity, visual perspective and the extent to which they were self-revealing. Memories were independently rated as self-defining or everyday experiences, and according to their valence and theme. Self-esteem and depressed mood were further assessed with self-report questionnaires. Results: There were no group differences in the ability to recognise self-defining memories as assessed by independent reports. Both groups also reported their self-defining memories to be more intense than their everyday memories. However adolescents with ASD, in contrast to non-ASD controls, reported self-defining memories to reveal less about them than everyday memories. Relative to controls, they retrieved fewer memories with an achievement theme and more memories with a recreational theme. The control group showed a bias towards retrieving positive rather than negative self-defining memories but the ASD group showed no such tendency. Self-esteem, but not mood was poorer in the ASD group and self-esteem was related to the retrieval of negative self-defining memories. Conclusions: Adolescents with ASD exhibit an instable self-representation; they recognise the types of past experiences that define them but feel weak connections with these memories.

"A. Gomez, S. Rousset and M. Baciu",2009,Egocentric-updating during navigation facilitates episodic memory retrieval,"Influential models suggest that spatial processing is essential for episodic memory [O’Keefe, J., & Nadel, L. (1978). The hippocampus as a cognitive map. London: Oxford University Press]. However, although several types of spatial relations exist, such as allocentric (i.e. object-to-object relations), egocentric (i.e. static object-to-self relations) or egocentric updated on navigation information (i.e. self-to-environment relations in a dynamic way), usually only allocentric representations are described as potentially subserving episodic memory [Nadel, L., & Moscovitch, M. (1998). Hippocampal contributions to cortical plasticity. Neuropharmacology, 37(4–5), 431–439]. This study proposes to confront the allocentric representation hypothesis with an egocentric updated with self-motion representation hypothesis. In the present study, we explored retrieval performance in relation to these two types of spatial processing levels during learning. Episodic remembering has been assessed through Remember responses in a recall and in a recognition task, combined with a “Remember-Know-Guess” paradigm [Gardiner, J. M. (2001). Episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness: A first-person approach. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 356(1413), 1351–1361] to assess the autonoetic level of responses. Our results show that retrieval performance was significantly higher when encoding was performed in the egocentric-updated condition. Although egocentric updated with self-motion and allocentric representations are not mutually exclusive, these results suggest that egocentric updating processing facilitates remember responses more than allocentric processing. The results are discussed according to Burgess and colleagues’ model of episodic memory [Burgess, N., Becker, S., King, J. A., & O’Keefe, J. (2001).

DM, a developmental amnesic, was impaired in her ability to process self-motion (i.e., idiothetic) information while her ability to process external stable landmarks (i.e., allothetic) was preserved when no self-motion processing was required. On a naturalistic and incidental episodic task, DM was severely and predictably impaired on both free and cued recall tasks.

Patient M.R. suffers from amnesia, due to bilateral hippocampal lesion and temporoparietal atrophy following carbon monoxide poisoning. We compared his performance in immediate spatial memory tasks with the performance of ten healthy matched participants. Using an immediate reproduction of path, we observed a dissociation between his performance in three allocentric tasks and in five egocentric-updating tasks. His performance was always impaired on tasks requiring the use of an egocentric-updating representation but remained preserved on allocentric tasks. These results fit with the hypothesis that the hippocampus plays a role in spatial memory, but they also suggest that allocentric deficits previously observed in amnesia might actually reflect deficits in egocentric-updating processes. Furthermore, the cooccurrence of deficits in episodic long-term memory and short-term egocentric-updating representation without any short-term allocentric deficit suggests a new link between the mnemonic and navigational roles of the hippocampus. The Cognitive Map theory, the Multiple Trace theory, as well as further models linking spatial and nonspatial functions of the hippocampus are discussed.

This is important provided that positive imagery can be an effective mood repair strategy in healthy individuals. However, (sub-clinical) depressed individuals tend to spontaneously adopt an observer perspective.

We aimed to examine differences between memory recall from a field perspective and observer perspective at the neurobiological level, in order to improve our understanding of what is underlying the observed differences at the behavioral level. We conducted a fMRI study in healthy individuals, comparing imagery perspectives during recall of neutral and positive autobiographical memories. Behavioral results revealed field perspective imagery of positive memories, as compared to observer perspective, to be associated with more positive feelings afterwards. At the neurobiological level, contrasting observer perspective to field perspective imagery was associated with greater activity, or less decrease relative to the control visual search task, in the right precuneus and in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Greater activity in the right TPJ during an observer perspective as compared to field perspective could reflect performing a greater shift of perspective and mental state during observer perspective imagery than field perspective imagery. Differential activity in the precuneus may reflect that during observer perspective imagery individuals are more likely to engage in (self-) evaluative processing and visuospatial processing. Our findings contribute to a growing understanding of how imagery perspective can influence the type of information that is recalled and the intensity of the emotional response. Observer perspective imagery may not automatically reduce emotional intensity but this could depend on how the imagined situation is evaluated in relation to the self-concept.",Brain and cognition,111,,13-24,10.1016/j.bandc.2016.09.014

Results showed that when narrative perspectives effectively shifted participants' visual perspectives from field to observer, they felt attenuated emotional intensities of positive and negative autobiographical memories. However, this did not occur when narrative perspectives effectively shifted the visual perspectives from observer to field. Multiple mediator models further showed that the changes in psychological distance and imagery vividness (a distance-related construct) of autobiographical memory mediated the relationship between the narrative perspective shift from the 1st- to 3rd-person and the reduction in the intensities of negative and positive emotion. This provides support for the role of psychological distancing in reducing the emotional intensity of autobiographical memory.",Consciousness and cognition,45,,159-173,10.1016/j.concog.2016.09.001

We investigated allocentric spatial recall using a virtual environment in a group of patients with severe hippocampal damage (SHD), a group of patients with moderate hippocampal damage (MHD), and a normal control group. Through four learning blocks with feedback, participants learned the target locations of four different objects in a circular arena. Distal cues were present throughout the experiment to provide orientation. A circular boundary as well as an intra-arena landmark provided spatial reference frames. During a subsequent test phase, recall of all four objects was tested with only the boundary or the landmark being present. Patients with SHD were impaired in both phases of this task. Across groups, performance on both types of spatial recall was highly correlated with memory quotient (MQ), but not with intelligence quotient (IQ), age, or sex. However, both measures of spatial recall separated experimental groups beyond what would be expected based on MQ, a widely used measure of general memory function. Boundary-based and landmark-based spatial recall were both strongly related to bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not to volumes of the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, or caudate nucleus. The results show that boundary-based and landmark-based allocentric spatial recall are similarly impaired in patients with SHD, that both types of recall are impaired beyond that predicted by MQ, and that recall deficits are best explained by a reduction in bilateral hippocampal volumes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn humans, bilateral hippocampal atrophy can lead to profound impairments in episodic memory. Across species, perhaps the most well-established contribution of the hippocampus to memory is not to episodic memory generally but to allocentric spatial memory. However, the extent to which navigational spatial memory depends on hippocampal integrity in humans is not well documented. We investigated spatial recall using a virtual environment in two groups of patients with hippocampal damage (moderate/severe) and a normal control group. The results showed that patients with severe hippocampal damage are impaired in learning and recalling allocentric spatial information. Furthermore, hippocampal volume reduction impaired allocentric navigation beyond what can be predicted by memory quotient as a widely used measure of general memory function.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,35,42,14123-14131,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0801-15.2015

Cangoz,2016,Effects of Emotion and Perspective on Remembering Events: An Eye-Tracking Study,"The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the emotional content of an event and participants' perspective on the memory and eye-tracking measurements for central and peripheral details. The data have been collected from 130 undergraduate male students (18- 33 ages). Three series of seven different emotional thematic photographs (positive, negative, neutral) were used. Participants were subjected to only one of the three series, either in his own perspective condition or observer perspective condition. During the presentation of thematic photograph series participants' eye movements were recorded. All analysis for memory and eye-tracking measurements were carried out with 3 (Emotional Content: Positive, Negative, Neutral) X 2 (Participants' perspective: Own perspective, observer perspective) between-subjects factorial ANOVA. The results indicated that although central and peripheral details took almost equal attention in both negative and neutral events, only details of the negative event was remembered better. In addition, when compared to negative and neutral events participants looked longer at positive event's central details as well as peripheral details, only details of negative event were remembered better. Consequently, memory enhancement effect occured only in negative emotional event both for central and peripheral details, even though participants paid less or equal attention these details. In addition to effects of emotion, it was seen that like autobiographical memory (Nigro and Neisser, 1983) participants' perspective has also an effect on event memory and attention measured by eye-tracking. According to eye-tracking results looking with his own perspective to the event causes narrowing of attention while looking with observer's perspective to event causes extending of attention. In memory results it was seen that participants in his own perspective condition remembered central details better than participants in the observer condition. In conclusion, it is observed that enhanced memory for negative emotional event can occur independently of attention, so it could be said that attention is not sufficient by itself to remember an event with details, emotional dimension of the event has a decisive role. Additionally, perspective have an effect on attention as well as event memory.",Journal of Eye Movement Research,9,2,,

However, empirical evidence linking hippocampal activity to the perceptual experience of being physically located at a particular place in the environment is lacking. In this study, we used a multisensory out-of-body illusion to perceptually 'teleport' six healthy participants between two different locations in the scanner room during high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants were fitted with MRI-compatible head-mounted displays that changed their first-person visual perspective to that of a pair of cameras placed in one of two corners of the scanner room. To elicit the illusion of being physically located in this position, we delivered synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation in the form of an object moving toward the cameras coupled with touches applied to the participant's chest. Asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation did not induce the illusion and served as a control condition. We found that illusory self-location could be successfully decoded from patterns of activity in the hippocampus in all of the participants in the synchronous (P < 0.05) but not in the asynchronous condition (P > 0.05). At the group-level, the decoding accuracy was significantly higher in the synchronous than in the asynchronous condition (P = 0.012). These findings associate hippocampal activity with the perceived location of the bodily self in space, which suggests that the human hippocampus is involved not only in spatial navigation and memory but also in the construction of our sense of bodily self-location.",Front Hum Neurosci,9,,412,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00412

When remembering and imagining, individuals can use both 1st person (field) and 3rd person (observer) perspectives. There is currently a paucity of research examining the visual perspectives of episodic future thoughts that represent possible selves. We hypothesised that temporally distant self-images would elicit more observer perspectives in episodic thoughts than temporally near self-images and current self-images. Utilising a repeated measures design, sixty-eight undergraduate students completed IAM, I Will Be near and I Will Be far conditions (Rathbone, Conway, & Moulin, 2011) to generate self-images and their related episodic thoughts. It was found that episodic qualities were reliably affected by different self-images. Specifically, observer perspective predilections increased with future temporal distance.

There were 168 persons >/=6 months post-TBI with irritability who were enrolled in a parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial receiving either amantadine 100 mg twice daily or equivalent placebo for 60 days. Subjects were assessed at baseline and days 28 (primary end-point) and 60 of treatment using observer-rated and participant-rated Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-I) Most Problematic item (primary outcome), NPI Most Aberrant item, and NPI-I Distress Scores, as well as physician-rated Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale. Observer ratings between the two groups were not statistically significantly different at day 28 or 60; however, observers rated the majority in both groups as having improved at both intervals. Participant ratings for day 60 demonstrated improvements in both groups with greater improvement in the amantadine group on NPI-I Most Problematic (p<0.04) and NPI-I Distress (p<0.04). These results were not significant with correction for multiple comparisons. CGI demonstrated greater improvement for amantadine than the placebo group (p<0.04). Adverse event occurrence did not differ between the two groups. While observers in both groups reported large improvements, significant group differences were not found for the primary outcome (observer ratings) at either day 28 or 60. This large placebo or nonspecific effect may have masked detection of a treatment effect. The result of this study of amantadine 100 mg every morning and noon to reduce irritability was not positive from the observer perspective, although there are indications of improvement at day 60 from the perspective of persons with TBI and clinicians that may warrant further investigation.",J Neurotrauma,32,16,1230-1238,10.1089/neu.2014.3803

However, recent findings from monkeys following selective hippocampal lesions have been equivocal. To approximate more closely the situations in which rodents and birds are tested, we used a spatial memory task in which rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) moved about freely in a large room, on a tether. We used MRI-guided stereotaxic surgery to produce selective hippocampal lesions in five monkeys, and retained five unoperated control monkeys. In the study phase of each trial of the matching-to-location task, monkeys found food in one site in an array of identical foraging sites. During the test, which occurred after a delay, monkeys could return to the site where the food had been found during study to obtain more food. In Experiment 1, normal monkeys showed a small significant tendency to return directly to a site where they had previously found food that day. Operated monkeys showed no such matching tendency. In Experiment 2, further training produced reliable matching-to-location performance in both groups at short delays, but monkeys with selective hippocampal lesions rapidly forgot the location of the food. In Experiment 3, we tested whether monkeys used a cognitive map to encode the location of the hidden food, by requiring them to relocate the food from a starting location different from that used during study. As a group, monkeys were more accurate than expected by chance, indicating that they did encode the rewarded location with respect to allocentric landmarks; however, both groups of monkeys were significantly worse at relocating the food when required to approach from a different location. In Experiment 4, probe trials using symmetrical test arrays found no evidence for egocentric coding of the rewarded location.",Hippocampus,14,7,808-818,10.1002/hipo.10217

We investigated whether direct and generative retrieval differed in the characteristics of memories recalled, or only in terms of retrieval latency. Participants recalled autobiographical memories in response to cue words. For each memory, they reported whether it was retrieved directly or generatively, rated its visuo-spatial perspective, and judged its accompanying recollective experience. Our results indicated that direct retrieval was commonly reported and was faster than generative retrieval, replicating recent findings. The characteristics of directly retrieved memories differed from generatively retrieved memories: directly retrieved memories had higher field perspective ratings and lower observer perspective ratings. However, retrieval mode did not influence recollective experience.

Nonetheless, the hippocampus may be specialized for allocentric topographical processing, which impacts on short-term memory or even perception. To investigate this we developed performance-matched tests of perception (match-to-sample) and short-term memory (2 s delayed-match-to-sample) for the topography and for the nonspatial aspects of visual scenes. Four patients with focal hippocampal damage and one with more extensive damage, including right parahippocampal gyrus, were tested. All five patients showed impaired topographical memory and spared nonspatial processing in both memory and perception. Topographical perception was profoundly impaired in the patient with parahippocampal damage, mildly impaired in two of the hippocampal cases, and clearly preserved in the other two hippocampal cases (including one with dense amnesia). Our results suggest that the hippocampus supports allocentric topographical processing that is indispensable when appropriately tested after even very short delays, while the presence of the sample scene can allow successful topographical perception without it, possibly via a less flexible parahippocampal representation.

F. Loftus and J. Pickrell (1995). Participants recalled events provided by parents on 3 separate occasions and were asked to imagine true and false unremembered events. True memories were rated by both participants and observers as more rich in recollective experience and were rated by participants as more important, more emotionally intense, as having clearer imagery, and as less typical than false memories. Rehearsal frequency was used as a covariate, eliminating these effects. Imagery in true memories was most often viewed from the field perspective, whereas imagery in false memories was most often viewed from the observer perspective. More information was communicated in true memories, and true memories contained more information concerning the consequences of described events. Results suggest repeated remembering can make false memories more rich in recollective experience and more like true memories. Differences between true and false memories suggest some potentially distinct characteristics of false memories and provide insight into the process of false memory creation.

"M. Hebscher, B. Levine and A. Gilboa",2018,The precuneus and hippocampus contribute to individual differences in the unfolding of spatial representations during episodic autobiographical memory,"Spatial information is a central aspect of episodic autobiographical memory (EAM). Space-based theories of memory, including cognitive map and scene construction models, posit that spatial reinstatement is a required process during early event recall. Spatial information can be represented from both allocentric (third-person) and egocentric (first-person) perspectives during EAM, with egocentric perspectives being important for mental imagery and supported by the precuneus. Individuals differ in their tendency to rely on allocentric or egocentric information, and in general, the subjective experience of remembering in EAM differs greatly across individuals. Here we examined individual differences in spatial aspects of EAM, how such differences influence the vividness and temporal order of recollection, and their anatomical correlates. We cued healthy young participants (n =63) with personally familiar locations and non-locations. We examined how cue type affects (i) retrieval dynamics and (ii) phenomenological aspects of remembering, and related behavioural performance to regional brain volumes (n =42). Participants tended to spontaneously recall spatial information early during recollection, even in the absence of spatial cues, and individuals with a stronger tendency to recall space first also displayed faster reaction times. Across participants, place-cued memories were re-experienced more vividly and were richer in detail than those cued by objects, but not more than those cued by familiar persons. Volumetric differences were associated with behavioural performance such that egocentric remembering was positively associated with precuneus volume. Hippocampal CA2/CA3 volumes were associated with the tendency to recall place-cued memories less effortfully. Consistent with scene construction theories, this study suggests that spatial information is reinstated early and contributes to the efficiency and phenomenology of EAM. However, early recall of spatial information is not universal and other routes to recall exist, challenging some aspects of these models. Variability among participants highlights the importance of an individual differences approach to studying EAM.",Neuropsychologia,110,,123-133,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.03.029
"I. J. Hepner, A. Mohamed, M. J. Fulham and L. A. Miller",2007,"Topographical, autobiographical and semantic memory in a patient with bilateral mesial temporal and retrosplenial infarction","According to Consolidation Theory (Squire, 1992, Psychological Review, 99, 195; Squire & Alvarez, 1995, Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 5, 169), the mesial temporal lobes have a time-limited role in the maintenance, storage and retrieval of retrograde declarative memories, such that they are not necessary for recalling remote memories. In contrast, proponents of the Multiple Trace Theory (Fuji, Moscovitch, & Nadel, 2000, Handbook of neuropsychology, 2nd ed., p 223, Amsterdam, New York: Elsevier; Nadel & Moscovitch, 1999, Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 7, 217) posit that the mesial temporal lobe (MTL) is necessary for remembering detailed autobiographical and topographical material from all time periods. A third theory of hippocampal function, the Cognitive Map Theory (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978, The hippocampus as a cognitive map. Oxford: Clarendon), states that the hippocampus is involved in the processing of allocentric spatial representations. The precise role of the MTL in remote memory has been difficult to elucidate, as the majority of studies present cases with widespread brain damage that often occurred many years prior to testing. We investigated retrograde autobiographical, semantic and topographical memories in a subject (SG) who had recently sustained infarctions confined to the MTL and retrosplenial region bilaterally. Inconsistent with the predictions of Cognitive Map Theory, memory for spatial maps that were learned in the past was preserved. Additional testing indicated that SG suffered from a landmark agnosia, which affected remotely and recently acquired information equally. SG was also poor at imagining which direction he would have to turn his body to move from one landmark to another. In accordance with Consolidation Theory, SG performed similarly to control subjects for remote time periods on various measures of retrograde autobiographical memory and demonstrated intact knowledge regarding famous faces and vocabulary terms that were acquired in the past. In contrast, memory for remote public events was impaired. The current findings indicate that the mesial temporal and/or retrosplenial regions have little role to play in memory for remotely acquired spatial maps, autobiographical memories, famous faces or vocabulary terms. However, the findings for landmark naming, directional calculations between landmarks and knowledge of public events suggest that the MTL and/or retrosplenial cortices remain important for accessing these types of memories indefinitely.

Research suggests the perspective adopted in mental imagery modulates its emotional impact. However, little is known about the impact of mental imagery in adolescence, despite adolescence being the key time for the onset of emotional dysfunction. We administered computerised positive versus mixed valence picture-word mental imagery training to male adolescent participants (N = 60, aged 11-16 years) across separate field and observer perspective sessions. Positive mood increased more following positive than mixed imagery; pleasantness ratings of ambiguous pictures increased following positive versus mixed imagery generated from field but not observer perspective; negative interpretation bias on a novel scrambled sentences task was smaller following positive than mixed imagery particularly when imagery was generated from field perspective. These findings suggest positive mental imagery generation alters mood and cognition in male adolescents, with the latter moderated by imagery perspective.

These concepts are applied to an implementation of a scenario where agents are interacting in a complex virtual artificial life environment. We present computational memory architectures for autobiographic virtual agents that enable agents to retrieve meaningful information from their dynamic memories which increases their adaptation and survival in the environment. The design of the memory architectures, the agents, and the virtual environment are described in detail. Next, a series of experimental studies and their results are presented which show the adaptive advantage of autobiographic memory, i.e. from remembering significant experiences. Also, in a multi-agent scenario where agents can communicate via stories based on their autobiographic memory, it is found that new adaptive behaviours can emerge from an individual's reinterpretation of experiences received from other agents whereby higher communication frequency yields better group performance. An interface is described that visualises the memory contents of an agent. From an observer perspective, the agents' behaviours can be understood as individually structured, and temporally grounded, and, with the communication of experience, can be seen to rely on emergent mixed narrative reconstructions combining the experiences of several agents. This research leads to insights into how bottom-up story-telling and autobiographic reconstruction in autonomous, adaptive agents allow temporally grounded behaviour to emerge. The article concludes with a discussion of possible implications of this research direction for future autobiographic, narrative agents.

C. Holscher,2003,"Time, space and hippocampal functions","The hippocampus is one of the most researched structures of the brain. Studies of lesions in humans, primates and rodents have suggested to some that the primary role of the hippocampus is to act as a temporary memory buffer which is required for the consolidation of long-term memory. The famous case study of patient H.M., in particular, seemed to suggest that the hippocampus was of crucial importance for memory formation. However, recordings of single neurons in freely moving rodents did not support this notion. In such recordings, neurons were found that were active predominately when the animal passed through a particular area in space. Consequently, these neurons were termed 'place cells' and a theory was developed that suggested that the hippocampus acts as a 'cognitive map' that is required for spatial orientation. It was then found that H.M. had significant damage to his temporal lobes that included the amygdala, rhinal cortices, and other areas. Further case studies and selective hippocampal lesions in primates resulted in much milder amnestic symptoms, and lesions of defined cortical areas in the temporal lobes showed that a number of functions previously attributed to the hippocampus were in fact linked to these areas. Further analysis of neuronal activity in the hippocampus showed that not only is spatial information represented there, but also additional information, such as speed of movement, direction of movement, match or non-match detection, olfactorial identification, and others. In addition, it was found that selective lesions of the hippocampus in rodents impaired spatial navigation and memory formation only mildly. Only simultaneous lesions of several cortical areas in conjunction with the hippocamus could reproduce the impairments and symptoms that were previously thought to be observed after hippocampal lesions alone. In conclusion it is proposed that information processing and memory formation is shared by several brain areas that act as a functional system. This review presents evidence from many different studies that the hippocampus is part of this system and plays a supportive role in associating complex multimodal information and laying down new memory traces. In addition, the concept of allocating specific functions (such as the development of a cognitive map) exclusively to the hippocampus is rejected.",Reviews in the Neurosciences,14,3,253-284,

In the central arm of the maze, 4 out of 45 cells (8%) were found that fired selectively depending on which turn the animals would take. This result is in disagreement with a previous study in which two-thirds of cells (22 out of 33) showed a clear bias for direction of turns. The interpretation was that the cells coded information of episodic memory. Our results do not support this hypothesis. Interestingly, over the course of training, an increasing number of cells were found that fired in correlation with the rats' movements. It is proposed that these cells associate egocentric motor information with allocentric spatial information rather than encode episodic memory.",Exp Brain Res,158,2,233-240,10.1007/s00221-004-1896-z
R. Hopkins,2014,Episodic memory as representing the past to oneself,"Episodic memory is sometimes described as mental time travel. This suggests three ideas: that episodic memory offers us access to the past that is quasi-experiential, that it is a source of knowledge of the past, and that it is, at root, passive. I offer an account of episodic memory that rejects all three ideas. The account claims that remembering is a matter of representing the past to oneself, in a way suitably responsive to how one experienced the remembered episode to be. I argue that episodic memory is active, in the way this view suggests. I clarify the idea that it is, as the view also implies, not a source of knowledge but an expression of knowledge the subject already has. And I suggest the view need not limit memories to states that are in any way experience-like. This position offers a way to articulate the relations between episodic memory and related phenomena: factual memory, generic memory, remembering-how and anticipation. And it allows us to explain how we know which aspects of our episodic memory states to take seriously and which (such as the shift to an observer perspective on the remembered events) to treat as merely incidental.

There is ample neurophysiological evidence that the MTL computes location in allocentric space and more recent evidence that the MTL also codes for time. Space and time represent a similar computational challenge; both are variables that cannot be simply calculated from the immediately available sensory information. We introduce a simple mathematical framework that computes functions of both spatial location and time as special cases of a more general computation. In this framework, experience unfolding in time is encoded via a set of leaky integrators. These leaky integrators encode the Laplace transform of their input. The information contained in the transform can be recovered using an approximation to the inverse Laplace transform. In the temporal domain, the resulting representation reconstructs the temporal history. By integrating movements, the equations give rise to a representation of the path taken to arrive at the present location. By modulating the transform with information about allocentric velocity, the equations code for position of a landmark. Simulated cells show a close correspondence to neurons observed in various regions for all three cases. In the temporal domain, novel secondary analyses of hippocampal time cells verified several qualitative predictions of the model. An integrated representation of spatiotemporal context can be computed by taking conjunctions of these elemental inputs, leading to a correspondence with conjunctive neural representations observed in dorsal CA1.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,34,13,4692-4707,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5808-12.2014

Roberts' (1997) assertion that cultural practices of sexually objectifying women's bodies socialize women to internalize an observer's perspective on their physical selves. Autobiographical memories can contain images from 2 perspectives: the original, first person perspective (field images) and that of an outside observer (observer images). The authors collected autobiographical memories for events in general and for specific, potentially objectifying situations from a predominantly European-American sample of 138 female and 104 male students at a private university. Results demonstrated that female participants reported more observer imagery than male participants both for memories in general and for memories of certain situations wherein women are likely to be sexually objectified. Women's and men's emotional responses to these situations were also different, with women reporting more negative affect, including shame and anxiety, and less positive affect.

This differential focus on source information during collaborative recall impacted performance on a later source memory test.

Both representations can be identified in hippocampal activity before their effect on behavior at subsequent choice-points.

The sequential egocentric strategy differs from a succession of independent simple egocentric responses as it requires a sequential ordering of events, possibly sharing functional similarity with episodic memory in this regard. To question the possible simultaneous encoding of sequential egocentric and allocentric strategies, we developed a paradigm in which these two strategies are spontaneously used or imposed. Our results evidenced that sequential egocentric strategy can be spontaneously acquired at the onset of the training as well as allocentric strategy. Allocentric and sequential egocentric strategies could be used together within a trial, and bidirectional shifts (between trials) were spontaneously performed during the training period by 30% of the participants. Regardless of the strategy used spontaneously during the training, all participants could execute immediate shifts to the opposite non previously used strategy when this strategy was imposed. Altogether, our findings suggest that subjects acquire different types of spatial knowledge in parallel, namely knowledge permitting allocentric navigation as well as knowledge permitting sequential egocentric navigation.",Hippocampus,19,12,1199-1211,10.1002/hipo.20595

To further understand the unravelling of the recollective experience in pathological ageing, we investigated autobiographical memory (ABM) using the Episodic Autobiographical Memory Interview (EAMI) in thirty middle-aged and thirty healthy elderly controls, and twenty patients with mild AD. Of key interest was the recall of contextual details and the behavioural markers predictive of autonoetic reliving. AD patients exhibited significant difficulties in recalling contextual details across all life epochs on the EAMI manifesting in a negative temporal gradient from the Early Adulthood epoch onwards. Overall there was a low incidence of autonoetic consciousness during ABM recall across all participant groups and life epochs when compared with previous studies. AD patients showed a compromised capacity to mentally relive past memories (AD<healthy elderly<middle-aged controls), across all life epochs on the EAMI. AD patients tended to recall past events as semanticised accounts divested of rich sensory-perceptual imagery.

Although autobiographical memories are typically encoded from the visual perspective of our own eyes they can be retrieved from the perspective of an observer looking at our self. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of shifting visual perspective during long-term memory retrieval and its influence on online and subsequent memories using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants generated specific autobiographical memories from the last five years and rated their visual perspective. In a separate fMRI session, they were asked to retrieve the memories across three repetitions while maintaining the same visual perspective as their initial rating or by shifting to an alternative perspective. Visual perspective shifting during autobiographical memory retrieval was supported by a linear decrease in neural recruitment across repetitions in the posterior parietal cortices. Additional analyses revealed that the precuneus, in particular, contributed to both online and subsequent changes in the phenomenology of memories. Our findings show that flexibly shifting egocentric perspective during autobiographical memory retrieval is supported by the precuneus, and suggest that this manipulation of mental imagery during retrieval has consequences for how memories are retrieved and later remembered.

Previous work suggested impaired spatial navigation in patients with bilateral vestibular failure (BVF). The aim of this study was to investigate event-related brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during spatial navigation and visual memory tasks in BVF patients. METHODS: Twenty-three BVF patients and healthy age- and gender matched control subjects performed learning sessions of spatial navigation by watching short films taking them through various streets from a driver's perspective along a route to the Cathedral of Cologne using virtual reality videos (adopted and modified from Google Earth). In the scanner, participants were asked to respond to questions testing for visual memory or spatial navigation while they viewed short video clips. From a similar but not identical perspective depicted video frames of routes were displayed which they had previously seen or which were completely novel to them. RESULTS: Compared with controls, posterior cerebellar activity in BVF patients was higher during spatial navigation than during visual memory tasks, in the absence of performance differences. This cerebellar activity correlated with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar activity during spatial navigation in BVF patients may reflect increased non-vestibular efforts to counteract the development of spatial navigation deficits in BVF. Conceivably, cerebellar activity indicates a change in navigational strategy of BVF patients, i.e. from a more allocentric, landmark or place-based strategy (hippocampus) to a more sequence-based strategy.

However, few studies investigated the neurochemical mechanisms that mediate the prefrontal retrieval process. In the current study, we examined whether N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the mPFC were necessary for retrieval of a well-learned spatial location on the basis of partial or degraded spatial cues. Rats were initially trained to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze using four extramaze cues in the surrounding environment. Their retrieval performance was subsequently tested under different cue conditions. Infusions of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a NMDAR antagonist, significantly disrupted memory retrieval when three of the original cues were removed. By contrast, APV injections into the mPFC did not affect animals' retrieval performance when the original cues were presented or when three novels landmarks were added alongside the original cues. These results indicate that prefrontal NMDARs are required for memory retrieval when allocentric spatial information is degraded. NMDAR-dependent neurotransmission in the mPFC may facilitate an active retrieval process to reactivate complete contextual representations associated with partial retrieval cues.",Neurobiology of learning and memory,109,,20-26,10.1016/j.nlm.2013.11.004

In the present study, long-term recall of spatial arrays following incidental learning (text messaging or calculator use) was tested under three different motor conditions at retrieval. For both letter and number arrays, the accuracy of recall was found to be improved by relevant enactment at the time of retrieval, relative to retrieval with no movement. In contrast, irrelevant movement was found to produce an impairment in accuracy. The overall accuracy of recalling a letter array was found to be a power-law function of the frequency of exposure to the array. The findings are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that appropriate movement during memory retrieval recruits egocentric representations that supplement allocentric representations subserving longer term spatial recall.

"T. Katus, M. M. Muller and M.

We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to demonstrate that tactile WM representations are stored in modality-specific cortical regions, that the goal-directed modulation of these representations is mediated through hemispheric-specific activation of somatosensory areas, and that the rehearsal of somatotopic coordinates in memory is accomplished by modality-specific spatial attention mechanisms. Participants encoded two tactile sample stimuli presented simultaneously to the left and right hands, before visual retro-cues indicated which of these stimuli had to be retained to be matched with a subsequent test stimulus on the same hand. Retro-cues triggered a sustained tactile contralateral delay activity component with a scalp topography over somatosensory cortex contralateral to the cued hand. Early somatosensory ERP components to task-irrelevant probe stimuli (that were presented after the retro-cues) and to subsequent test stimuli were enhanced when these stimuli appeared at the currently memorized location relative to other locations on the cued hand, demonstrating that a precise focus of spatial attention was established during the selective maintenance of tactile events in WM. These effects were observed regardless of whether participants performed the matching task with uncrossed or crossed hands, indicating that WM representations in this task were based on somatotopic rather than allocentric spatial coordinates. In conclusion, spatial rehearsal in tactile WM operates within somatotopically organized sensory brain areas that have been recruited for information storage.",J Neurosci,35,4,1390-1395,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3535-14.2015
P. J. Kennedy and M. L. Shapiro,2009,Motivational states activate distinct hippocampal representations to guide goal-directed behaviors,"Adaptive behaviors are guided by motivation and memory. Motivational states specify goals, and memory can inform motivated behavior by providing detailed records of past experiences when goals were obtained. These 2 fundamental processes interact to guide animals to biologically relevant targets, but the neuronal mechanisms that integrate them remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we recorded unit activity from the same population of hippocampal neurons as rats performed identical tasks while either food or water deprived. We compared the influence of motivational state (hunger and thirst), memory demand, and spatial behavior in 2 tasks: hippocampus-dependent contextual memory retrieval and hippocampus- independent random foraging. We found that: (i) hippocampal coding was most strongly influenced by motivational state during contextual memory retrieval, when motivational cues were required to select among remembered, goal-directed actions in the same places; (ii) the same neuronal populations were relatively unaffected by motivational state during random foraging, when hunger and thirst were incidental to behavior, and signals derived from deprivation states thus informed, but did not determine, hippocampal coding; and (iii) ‘‘prospective coding’’ in the contextual retrieval task was not influenced by allocentric spatial trajectory, but rather by the animal’s deprivation state and the associated, nonspatial target, suggesting that hippocampal coding includes a wide range of predictive associations. The results show that beyond coding spatiotemporal context, hippocampal representations encode the relationships between internal states, the external environment, and action to provide a mechanism by which motivation and memory are coordinated to guide behavior.

"S. Kim, J. Lee and I. Lee",2012,"The hippocampus is required for visually cued contextual response selection, but not for visual discrimination of contexts","The hippocampus is important for spatial navigation. Literature shows that allocentric visual contexts in the animal’s background are critical for making conditional response selections during navigations. In a traditional maze task, however, it is difficult to identify exactly which subsets of visual contexts are critically used. In the current study, we tested in rats whether making conditional response selections required the hippocampus when using computer-generated visual contextual stimuli in the animal’s background as in primate and human studies. We designed a new task, visual contextual response selection (VCRS) task, in which the rat ran along a linear track and encountered a touchscreen monitor at the end of the track. The rat was required to touch one of the adjacent rectangular box images depending on the visual contextual stimuli displayed in the two peripheral monitors positioned on both sides of the center touchscreen monitor. The rats with a GABA-A receptor agonist, muscimol (MUS), infused bilaterally in the dorsal hippocampi showed severe performance deficits in the VCRS task and the impairment was completely reversible with vehicle injections. The impairment in contextual response selection with hippocampal inactivations occurred regardless of whether the visual context was presented in the side monitors or in the center touchscreen monitor. However, when the same visual contextual stimuli were pitted against each other between the two side monitors and as the rats simply ran toward the visual context associated with reward on a T-shaped track, hippocampal inactivations with MUS showed minimal disruptions, if any, in performance. Our results suggest that the hippocampus is critically involved in conditional response selection using visual stimuli in the background, but it is not required for the perceptual discrimination of those stimuli.

A developmental amnesic case with focal bilateral hippocampal pathology showed a massive additional impairment when tested from the shifted viewpoint compared with a mild, list length-dependent, impairment when tested from the same viewpoint. While the same-view condition could be solved by visual pattern matching, the shifted-view condition requires a viewpoint independent representation or an equivalent mechanism for translating or rotating viewpoints in memory. The latter mechanism was indicated by control subjects' response latencies in the shifted-view condition, although the amnesic case is not impaired in tests of mental rotation of single objects. These results show that the human hippocampus supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory, and suggest that it does so by providing a mechanism for viewpoint manipulation in memory.

The self-defining moral memory was shown to be relatively more easy to access (accessibility), logically structured (coherence), vivid, seen from the first-person perspective (visual perspective), real (sensory detail); but was relatively less positive (valence), emotionally intense, chronologically clear (time perspective), in agreement with the present self (distancing), and shared. Finally, it was indicated that the more guilt people felt the more hidden/denied (less accessible), but more real (more sensory details), the self-defining moral memory.

"B. S. Kolarik, T. Baer, K. Shahlaie, A. P. Yonelinas and A. D. Ekstrom",2018,Close but no cigar: Spatial precision deficits following medial temporal lobe lesions provide novel insight into theoretical models of navigation and memory,"Increasing evidence suggests that the human hippocampus contributes to a range of different behaviors, including episodic memory, language, short-term memory, and navigation. A novel theoretical framework, the Precision and Binding Model, accounts for these phenomenon by describing a role for the hippocampus in high-resolution, complex binding. Other theories like Cognitive Map Theory, in contrast, predict a specific role for the hippocampus in allocentric navigation, while Declarative Memory Theory predicts a specific role in delay-dependent conscious memory. Navigation provides a unique venue for testing these predictions, with past results from research with humans providing inconsistent findings regarding the role of the human hippocampus in spatial navigation. Here, we tested five patients with lesions primarily restricted to the hippocampus and those extending out into the surrounding medial temporal lobe cortex on a virtual water maze task. Consistent with the Precision and Binding Model, we found partially intact allocentric memory in all patients, with impairments in the spatial precision of their searches for a hidden target. We found similar impairments at both immediate and delayed testing. Our findings are consistent with the Precision and Binding Model of hippocampal function, arguing for its role across domains in high-resolution, complex binding.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRemembering goal locations in one's environment is a critical skill for survival. How this information is represented in the brain is still not fully understood, but is believed to rely in some capacity on structures in the medial temporal lobe. Contradictory findings from studies of both humans and animals have been difficult to reconcile with regard to the role of the MTL, specifically the hippocampus. By assessing impairments observed during navigation to a goal in patients with medial temporal lobe damage we can better understand the role these structures play in such behavior. Utilizing virtual reality and novel analysis techniques, we have more precisely assessed the impact that medial temporal lobe damage has on spatial memory and navigation.",Hippocampus,28,1,31-41,10.1002/hipo.22801
"S. Kuhn, T. Gleich, R. C. Lorenz, U. Lindenberger and J. Gallinat",2014,Playing Super Mario induces structural brain plasticity: gray matter changes resulting from training with a commercial video game,"Video gaming is a highly pervasive activity, providing a multitude of complex cognitive and motor demands. Gaming can be seen as an intense training of several skills. Associated cerebral structural plasticity induced has not been investigated so far. Comparing a control with a video gaming training group that was trained for 2 months for at least 30 min per day with a platformer game, we found significant gray matter (GM) increase in right hippocampal formation (HC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral cerebellum in the training group. The HC increase correlated with changes from egocentric to allocentric navigation strategy. GM increases in HC and DLPFC correlated with participants' desire for video gaming, evidence suggesting a predictive role of desire in volume change. Video game training augments GM in brain areas crucial for spatial navigation, strategic planning, working memory and motor performance going along with evidence for behavioral changes of navigation strategy. The presented video game training could therefore be used to counteract known risk factors for mental disease such as smaller hippocampus and prefrontal cortex volume in, for example, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disease.",Molecular Psychiatry,19,2,265-271,10.1038/mp.2013.120
M. V. Kuruvilla and J. A. Ainge,2017,Lateral Entorhinal Cortex Lesions Impair Local Spatial Frameworks,"A prominent theory in the neurobiology of memory processing is that episodic memory is supported by contextually gated spatial representations in the hippocampus formed by combining spatial information from medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) with non-spatial information from lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). However, there is a growing body of evidence from lesion and single-unit recording studies in rodents suggesting that LEC might have a role in encoding space, particularly the current and previous locations of objects within the local environment. Landmarks, both local and global, have been shown to control the spatial representations hypothesized to underlie cognitive maps. Consequently, it has recently been suggested that information processing within this network might be organized with reference to spatial scale with LEC and MEC providing information about local and global spatial frameworks respectively. In the present study, we trained animals to search for food using either a local or global spatial framework. Animals were re-tested on both tasks after receiving excitotoxic lesions of either the MEC or LEC. LEC lesioned animals were impaired in their ability to learn a local spatial framework task. LEC lesioned animals were also impaired on an object recognition (OR) task involving multiple local features but unimpaired at recognizing a single familiar object. Together, this suggests that LEC is involved in associating features of the local environment. However, neither LEC nor MEC lesions impaired performance on the global spatial framework task.",Frontiers in systems neuroscience,11,,30,10.3389/fnsys.2017.00030
W. Kuyken and R. Howell,2006,Facets of autobiographical memory in adolescents with major depressive disorder and never-depressed controls,"Adolescence is a crucial developmental window because it involves elaboration of the self-concept, the laying down of lifelong autobiographical memories, and the development of emotional resilience during a time of substantial risk for mood problems. Autobiographical memory retrieval plays an important role in depression both in adults ( van Vreeswijk & de Wilde, 2004 ) and adolescents (Kuyken, Howell, & Dalgleish, 2005; Park, Goodyer, & Teasdale, 2002 ). This study examined facets of autobiographical memory associated with memory retrieval in never-depressed and currently depressed adolescents: personal importance, imagery, recency, source monitoring, and field-observer perspective. Compared with never-depressed adolescents, adolescents with depression were significantly more likely to retrieve memories from an observer perspective and more recent time period, preferentially rehearsed negative memories and rated their memories as more personally important. Depressed adolescents who reported a history of trauma retrieved more vivid autobiographical memories than depressed adolescents not reporting such a history, had rehearsed them more frequently, and reported more confidence in their veracity.",Cognition & emotion,20,3-4,466-487,10.1080/02699930500342639
W. Kuyken and M. L. Moulds,2009,Remembering as an observer: How is autobiographical memory retrieval vantage perspective linked to depression?,"It has long been noted that the emotional impact of an autobiographical memory is associated with the vantage perspective from which it is recalled (Freud, 1950). Memories recalled from a first-person “field” perspective are phenomenologically rich, while third-person “observer” perspective memories contain more descriptive but less affective detail (Nigro & Neisser, 1983). Although there is some evidence that depressed individuals retrieve more observer memories than non-depressed individuals (e.g., Kuyken & Howell, 2006), little is known of the cognitive mechanisms associated with observer memories in depression. At pre- and post-treatment, 123 patients with a history of recurrent depression completed self-report measures and the autobiographical memory task (AMT). Participants also indicated the vantage perspective of the memories recalled on the AMT. Observer memories were less vivid, older, and more frequently rehearsed. The tendency to retrieve observer perspective memories was associated with greater negative self-evaluation, lower dispositional mindfulness, and greater use of avoidance. Furthermore, participants who recalled more field perspective memories at pre-treatment had lower levels of post-treatment depression, controlling for pre-treatment levels of depression and trait rumination. We apply contemporary accounts from social and cognitive psychology, and propose potential mechanisms that link the tendency to retrieve observer perspective memories to depression.

OBJECTIVE: To test hypothesis that spatial navigation is impaired early in MCI patients representing the presymptomatic stage of AD. METHODS: We tested patients with probable AD (n = 21), MCI, further classified according to Petersen's criteria as amnestic MCI (aMCI) single domain (n = 11), aMCI multiple domain (n = 31), or nonamnestic MCI (n = 7). The aMCI group was also stratified using cued recall according to Dubois' criteria into memory impairment of the hippocampal type (n = 10) and isolated memory retrieval impairment-nonhippocampal (n = 32) and also according to ApoE4 status into E4+ (n = 12) and E4- (n = 30). These patients and controls (n = 28) were tested in the human variant of the Morris water maze. Depending on the subtest, the subjects could use the egocentric or allocentric (hippocampus-dependent) navigation. RESULTS: The AD and aMCI multiple domain groups were impaired in all subtests. The aMCI single domain group was impaired in allocentric subtests. The hippocampal MCI group performed poorer than the nonhippocampal MCI group and similarly to the AD group. The ApoE4+ group was as bad as the AD group when compared with the E4- group. CONCLUSION: aMCI subjects represent a very heterogeneous population, and spatial memory or cued recall examination can add more value to aMCI classification. ApoE4+ patients are more impaired than ApoE4- patients.",Neurodegener Dis,7,1-3,148-152,10.1159/000289226
"M. Lafon, M. Vidal and A. Berthoz",2009,Selective influence of prior allocentric knowledge on the kinesthetic learning of a path,"Spatial cognition studies have described two main cognitive strategies involved in the memorization of traveled paths in human navigation. One of these strategies uses the action-based memory (egocentric) of the traveled route or paths, which involves kinesthetic memory, optic flow, and episodic memory, whereas the other strategy privileges a survey memory of cartographic type (allocentric). Most studies have dealt with these two strategies separately, but none has tried to show the interaction between them in spite of the fact that we commonly use a map to imagine our journey and then proceed using egocentric navigation. An interesting question is therefore: how does prior allocentric knowledge of the environment affect the egocentric, purely kinesthetic navigation processes involved in human navigation? We designed an experiment in which blindfolded subjects had first to walk and memorize a path with kinesthetic cues only. They had previously been shown a map of the path, which was either correct or distorted (consistent shrinking or growing). The latter transformations were studied in order to observe what influence a distorted prior knowledge could have on spatial mechanisms. After having completed the first learning travel along the path, they had to perform several spatial tasks during the testing phase: (1) pointing towards the origin and (2) to specific points encountered along the path, (3) a free locomotor reproduction, and (4) a drawing of the memorized path. The results showed that prior cartographic knowledge influences the paths drawn and the spatial inference capacity, whereas neither locomotor reproduction nor spatial updating was disturbed. Our results strongly support the notion that (1) there are two independent neural bases underlying these mechanisms: a map-like representation allowing allocentric spatial inferences, and a kinesthetic memory of self-motion in space; and (2) a common use of, or a switching between, these two strategies is possible. Nevertheless, allocentric representations can emerge from the experience of kinesthetic cues alone.

"F. R. Lambert, P. Lavenex and P. B. Lavenex",2015,Improvement of allocentric spatial memory resolution in children from 2 to 4 years of age,"Allocentric spatial memory, the memory for locations coded in relation to objects comprising our environment, is a fundamental component of episodic memory and is dependent on the integrity of the hippocampal formation in adulthood. Previous research from different laboratories reported that basic allocentric spatial memory abilities are reliably observed in children after 2 years of age. Based on work performed in monkeys and rats, we had proposed that the functional maturation of direct entorhinal cortex projections to the CA1 field of the hippocampus might underlie the emergence of basic allocentric spatial memory. We also proposed that the protracted development of the dentate gyrus and its projections to the CA3 field of the hippocampus might underlie the development of high-resolution allocentric spatial memory capacities, based on the essential contribution of these structures to the process known as pattern separation. Here, we present an experiment designed to assess the development of spatial pattern separation capacities and its impact on allocentric spatial memory performance in children from 18 to 48 months of age. We found that: (1) allocentric spatial memory performance improved with age, (2) as compared to younger children, a greater number of children older than 36 months advanced to the final stage requiring the highest degree of spatial resolution, and (3) children that failed at different stages exhibited difficulties in discriminating locations that required higher spatial resolution abilities. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that improvements in human spatial memory performance might be linked to improvements in pattern separation capacities.

Whereas basic allocentric spatial memory abilities are reliably observed in children after 2 years of age, coinciding with the offset of infantile amnesia, the resolution of allocentric spatial memory acquired over repeated trials improves from 2 to 4 years of age. Here, we first show that single‐trial allocentric spatial memory performance improves in children from 3.5 to 7 years of age, during the typical period of childhood amnesia. Second, we show that large individual variation exists in children's performance at this age. Third, and most importantly, we show that improvements in single‐trial allocentric spatial memory performance are due to an increasing ability to spatially and temporally separate locations and events. Such improvements in spatial and temporal processing abilities may contribute to the gradual offset of childhood amnesia.

The capacity to adopt and switch between different perspectives is, however, fundamental for ego- and allocentric spatial referencing. We tested whether schizophrenia patients are able to adopt and maintain a non-egocentric point of view in a complex visual environment. Twenty-four chronic schizophrenic outpatients (11 females) and 25 controls matched for age, gender, years of education and handedness were recruited from a population-based sample. In a virtual environment, participants had to make a decision as to which of two trash cans was closest to themselves (viewer-centered, egocentric), to a ball (object-centered, unstable allocentric), or to a palace (landmark-centered, stable allocentric). Main outcome measures were reaction time, error rate, learning rate and local task switch cost. While egocentric reaction time was preserved, patients showed an increased reaction time in both allocentric referencing conditions (stable and unstable) and an overall increased error rate. Switch cost was diminished in patients when changing from the egocentric to the landmark-centered condition and elevated when changing from the landmark-centered to the egocentric condition. The results imply that schizophrenia patients' adoption of an egocentric perspective is preserved. However, adopting an allocentric point of view and switching between egocentric and landmark-centered perspectives are impaired. Perturbations in non-egocentric referencing and transferring efficiently between different referential systems might contribute to altered personal and social world comprehension in schizophrenia.",Neuropsychologia,48,10,2922-2930,

Human data regarding the roles of the various subregional networks within the hippocampus is difficult to obtain. In this article we examine the current rodent literature on episodic-like memory and associative recognition and review the roles of the hippocampal subregions in these behavioural tasks. We focus on the large amount of recent data reporting roles for CA3 and CA1 in allocentric spatial and temporal associative memory respectively. Our own recent data are then presented detailing critical roles for CA3 and CA1 in an associative recognition task which does not require allocentric spatial or temporal processing. These data support more generic roles for CA3 and CA1 in episodic-like memory, based on anatomical and theoretical literature on hippocampal function. We also present a novel analysis of our data in which we suggest that the encoding of object, place and context information is unaffected by lesions of the hippocampus and therefore infer that it may be the storage or retrieval phase of this associative memory which is critically dependent on hippocampal function. In conclusion however, more specific anatomically and temporally controlled methods are needed to fully define the role of hippocampal subregions in episodic-like memory.

R. F. Langston and E. R. Wood,2010,"Associative Recognition and the Hippocampus: Differential Effects of Hippocampal Lesions on Object-Place, Object-Context and Object-Place-Context Memory","The hippocampus is thought to be required for the associative recognition of objects together with the spatial or temporal contexts in which they occur. However, recent data showing that rats with fornix lesions perform as well as controls in an object-place task, while being impaired on an object-place-context task (Eacott and Norman (2004) J Neurosci 24:1948-1953), suggest that not all forms of context-dependent associative recognition depend on the integrity of the hippocampus. To examine the role of the hippocampus in context-dependent recognition directly, the present study tested the effects of large, selective, bilateral hippocampus lesions in rats on performance of a series of spontaneous recognition memory tasks: object recognition, object-place recognition, object-context recognition and object-place-context recognition. Consistent with the effects of fornix lesions, animals with hippocampus lesions were impaired only on the object-place-context task. These data confirm that not all forms of context-dependent associative recognition are mediated by the hippocampus. Subsequent experiments suggested that the object-place task does not require an allocentric representation of space, which could account for the lack of impairment following hippocampus lesions. Importantly, as the object-place-context task has similar spatial requirements, the selective deficit in object-place-context recognition suggests that this task requires hippocampus-dependent neural processes distinct from those required for allocentric spatial memory, or for object memory, object-place memory or object-context memory. Two possibilities are that object, place, and context information converge only in the hippocampus, or that recognition of integrated object-place-context information requires a hippocampus-dependent mode of retrieval, such as recollection.",Hippocampus,20,10,1139-1153,10.1002/hipo.20714

However, little is known about how to ameliorate the negative effects of this ubiquitous social experience. A key preliminary strategy for developing effective methods to reduce the negative impact of ostracism is to examine factors that influence the persistence of these effects. Therefore, the authors examined whether the persistence of these negative effects is dependent on the vantage perspective from which an experience of exclusion is recalled. Using a virtual ball-toss game, being ostracized elicited an immediate aversive effect; furthermore, these effects persisted when individuals recalled the experience from an observer perspective compared with a field perspective. This study shows, for the first time, that the persistence of the debilitating effects of ostracism is influenced by how individuals recall that experience.

"P. B. Lavenex, D. G. Amaral and P. Lavenex",2006,Hippocampal lesion prevents spatial relational learning in adult macaque monkeys,"The role of the hippocampus in spatial learning and memory has been extensively studied in rodents. Comparable studies in nonhuman primates, however, are few, and findings are often contradictory. This may be attributable to the failure to distinguish between allocentric and egocentric spatial representations in experimental designs. For this experiment, six adult monkeys received bilateral hippocampal ibotenic acid lesions, and six control subjects underwent sham surgery. Freely moving monkeys then foraged for food located in two arrays of three distinct locations among 18 locations distributed in an open-field arena. Multiple goals and four pseudorandomly chosen entrance points precluded the monkeys' ability to rely on an egocentric strategy to identify food locations. Monkeys were tested in two conditions. First, local visual cues marked the food locations. Second, no local cues marked the food locations, so that monkeys had to rely on an allocentric (spatial relational) representation of the environment to discriminate these locations. Both hippocampal-lesioned and control monkeys discriminated the food locations in the presence of local cues. However, in the absence of local cues, control subjects discriminated the food locations, whereas hippocampal-lesioned monkeys were unable to do so. Interestingly, histological analysis of the brain of one control monkey whose behavior was identical to that of the experimentally lesioned animals revealed a bilateral ischemic lesion restricted to the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that the adult monkey hippocampal formation is critical for the establishment or use of allocentric spatial representations and that selective damage of the hippocampus prevents spatial relational learning in adult nonhuman primates.",Journal of Neuroscience,26,17,4546-4558,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5412-05.2006

To complement these findings, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that in healthy participants oddity judgment for novel trial-unique scenes, compared with face or size oddity, was associated with increased posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex activity. In contrast, perirhinal and anterior hippocampus activity was observed during unfamiliar trial-unique face oddity judgment, when contrasted with scene or size oddity tasks. Activity in all of these regions decreased as the stimuli were repeated across trials, reflecting the participants' increasing familiarity with the stimuli. This change was significant in all areas, with the exception of the perirhinal cortex, right anterior hippocampus, and to a lesser extent the left anterior hippocampus during face oddity judgment.

Kim,2010,The shift from a response strategy to object-in-place strategy during learning is accompanied by a matching shift in neural firing correlates in the hippocampus,"Hippocampal-dependent tasks often involve specific associations among stimuli (including egocentric information), and such tasks are therefore prone to interference from irrelevant task strategies before a correct strategy is found. Using an object-place paired-associate task, we investigated changes in neural firing patterns in the hippocampus in association with a shift in strategy during learning. We used an object-place paired-associate task in which a pair of objects was presented in two different arms of a radial maze. Each object was associated with reward only in one of the arms, thus requiring the rats to consider both object identity and its location in the maze. Hippocampal neurons recorded in CA1 displayed a dynamic transition in their firing patterns during the acquisition of the task across days, and this corresponded to a shift in strategy manifested in behavioral data. Specifically, before the rats learned the task, they chose an object that maintained a particular egocentric relationship with their body (response strategy) irrespective of the object identity. However, as the animal acquired the task, it chose an object according to both its identity and the associated location in the maze (object-in-place strategy). We report that CA1 neurons in the hippocampus changed their prospective firing correlates according to the dominant strategy (i.e., response versus object-in-place strategy) employed at a given stage of learning. The results suggest that neural firing pattern in the hippocampus is heavily influenced by the task demand hypothesized by the animal and the firing pattern changes flexibly as the perceived task demand changes.",Learning & Memory,17,8,381-393,10.1101/lm.1829110

This study aimed to examine visual perspective in healthy never-depressed subjects presenting with either genetic or psychological vulnerability for depression. Sixty healthy participants performed the Autobiographical Memory Test with an assessment of visual perspective. Genetic vulnerability was defined by the presence of at least one S or L(G) allele of the polymorphism of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR). Psychological vulnerability was defined by high scores of harm avoidance measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory. Life stress exposure, depressive mood, rumination, and familial history of depression were assessed through standardized procedures. Visual perspective for positive memories was independently predicted by both harm avoidance and a gene by environment interaction between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and life stress exposure.

These components can be difficult to dissociate using retrospective autobiographical stimuli collection. In this study, we manipulated the episodic/semantic distinction within prospectively collected autobiographical stimuli. Over several months, participants made recordings documenting specific episodes, repeated episodes, and world knowledge. These recordings were later played back to participants during scanning with functional MRI. The results indicated overlapping but distinct patterns of brain activity corresponding to episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. Both episodic and semantic autobiographical memory engaged the left anteromedial prefrontal cortex associated with self-reference, but the episodic condition did so to a greater degree. The episodic condition uniquely engaged the medial temporal, posterior cingulate, and diencephalic regions associated with remote memory recovery. Whereas the episodic condition engaged the right temporo-parietal cortex involved in reconstruction of spatial context and attentional orienting, the semantic condition engaged the left temporo-parietal and parieto-frontal systems involved in egocentric spatial processing and topdown attentional control. Episodic recollection was also associated with suppression of emotional paralimbic regions. These findings support a functional neuroanatomical dissociation between episodic and semantic autobiographical memory, providing concordance to amnesic syndromes with disproportionate impairment in one of these two forms of autobiographical memory.

"P. A. Leynes, B. Askin and J. D. Landau",2017,Visual perspective during remembering: ERP evidence of familiarity-based source monitoring,"Autobiographical recollections are accompanied by visual perspectives that can be either a view through the person's own eyes (first-person) or a view that integrates visual characteristics of the rememberer into the reconstructed scene (third-person). Some have argued that a third-person perspective serves as a coping mechanism allowing the person to distance themselves from details of painful memories. The study reported here created first- and third-person memories in a novel experimental paradigm. Later, participants discriminated between these perspectives on a source memory test while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Experimental evidence from the current study suggests that memories from different perspectives can be effectively modeled in the lab. Directly comparing first-person and third-person memories revealed no strong source memory or ERP differences; however, more first-person memories were recognized. Surprisingly, the modeling of the behavioral data using ROC curves and Dual Process Signal Detection (DPSD) measures of recollection and familiarity suggest that familiarity contributed to source judgments of both first- and third-person memories. The ERP data support this claim because the putative ERP correlate of familiarity (i.e., FN400) was observed during the source test. Because source monitoring tends to draw on recollection, evidence of familiarity-based source monitoring has been elusive, and these results support a key prediction of the Source Monitoring Framework (SMF) - that source decisions can be based on familiarity in some contexts (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993; Mitchell & Johnson, 2009).",Cortex,91,,157-168,10.1016/j.cortex.2016.12.003

A similar pattern emerged when participants imagined performing actions that varied in self-concept compatibility (Study 4). The authors conclude that on-line judgments of an action's self-concept compatibility affect the perspective used for image construction. Study 5 shows applied implications. Use of the 3rd-person perspective when recalling past episodes of overindulgent eating was related to optimism about behaving differently at an upcoming Thanksgiving dinner.

The present research suggests that people shift perspective not according to the pictured event's desirability but according to whether they focus on the experience of the event (first-person) or on the event's coherence with the self-concept (third-person). This explains why self-change promotes third-person imagery of prechange selves (Studies 1 and 2). And, the same mechanism determines perspective apart from self-change, in both memory and imagination (Studies 3 and 4). By demonstrating that people shift perspective according to whether they focus on the experience of an event or its self-concept coherence, these results suggest how perspective may function more broadly in social cognition, and specifically in the construction and maintenance of the temporally extended self.",Pers Soc Psychol Bull,37,5,714-726,10.1177/0146167211400207

A series of experiments measured and manipulated visual perspective in mental and photographic images to test the connection with action identification level.

On the eve of the 2004 U.S. presidential election, registered voters in Ohio were instructed to use either the first-person or the third-person perspective to picture themselves voting in the election. Picturing voting from the third-person perspective caused subjects to adopt a stronger pro-voting mind-set correspondent with the imagined behavior. Further, this effect on self-perception carried over to behavior, causing subjects who were instructed to picture voting from the third-person perspective to be significantly more likely to vote in the election.

Although previous research has established that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have diminished episodic memory, episodic future thinking has not previously been investigated within this population. In the present study, high-functioning adults with ASD were compared to closely matched typical adults on a task requiring participants to report a series of events that happened to them in the past and a series of events that might happen to them in the future. For each event described, participants completed two modified Memory Characteristics Questionnaire items to assess self-reported phenomenal qualities associated with remembering and imagining, including self-perspective and degree of autonoetic awareness. Participants also completed letter, category, and ideational fluency tasks. Results indicated that participants with ASD recalled/imagined significantly fewer specific events than did comparison participants and that participants with ASD demonstrated impaired episodic memory and episodic future thinking. In line with this finding, participants with ASD were less likely than comparison participants to report taking a field (first-person) perspective and were more likely to report taking an observer (third-person) perspective during retrieval of past events (but not during simulation of future events), highlighting that they were less likely to mentally reexperience past events from their own point of view. There were no group differences in self-reported levels of autonoetic awareness or fluency task performance.

M. V. Lombardo and S. Baron-Cohen,2010,Unraveling the paradox of the autistic self,"Paradoxically, individuals with autism spectrum conditions have been characterized as both impaired in self-referential cognitive processing, yet also egocentric. How can the self in autism be both 'absent' (i.e., impaired self-referential cognition), yet 'all too present' (i.e., egocentric)? In this paper, we first review evidence in support of both claims. Second, we highlight new evidence illustrating atypical function of neural systems underlying self-representation in autism. We suggest that egocentrism and impaired self-referential cognition are not independent phenomena. Instead, both egocentrism and impaired self-referential cognition in autism can be resolved as expressions of one common mechanism linked to the atypical function of neural circuitry coding for self-relevant information. We discuss how autism provides a unique window into the neurodevelopmental mechanisms enabling a critical developmental transition in self-awareness. This transition involves a dual understanding that one is similar to, yet distinct from others. The neural and cognitive basis of this developmental transition is central to understanding the development of social cognition as well as the paradox of the autistic self and its relation to social impairment in autism.

The lesioned animals were divided into 3 groups: i) Baseline Acquisition Paradigm (BAP) once daily for 30days starting 1week post-surgery; ii) Early Intensive Acquisition Paradigm (EIAP) 3 times daily for 10days starting 1week post-surgery; and iii) Late Intensive Acquisition Paradigm (LIAP) 3 times daily for 10days starting 3weeks post-surgery. Within the control animals, one group followed the schedule of BAP, and one group followed the schedule of Intensive Acquisition Paradigm (IAP). All lesioned animals showed an impaired task acquisition. LIAP was beneficial in FF animals, in that it led to a better acquisition of the place learning task than the two other acquisition paradigms.

M. Marchlewska and A. Cichocka,2017,An autobiographical gateway: Narcissists avoid first-person visual perspective while retrieving self-threatening memories,"This research examines the role of narcissistic versus genuine self-evaluation in the retrieval of self-threatening memories. Autobiographical memories can be retrieved either from a first-person or a third-person visual perspective. Because narcissism is linked to sensitivity to psychological threats, it should predict retrieval of self-threatening memories using the third-person perspective. Genuine self-esteem, on the other hand, is resilient to threats. Therefore, it should be associated with retrieving self-relevant, even if threatening, memories from the first-person perspective. In two experiments we measured narcissism and self-esteem. Experiment 1 manipulated valence of self-relevant memories by asking participants to recall self-threatening (shameful) or self-boosting (proud) situations. Experiment 2 manipulated self-relevance of negative memories by asking participants to recall self-threatening (shameful) or negative, yet not self-threatening (sad) situations. Visual perspective of memory retrieval served as the dependent variable. In Experiment 1, narcissism predicted avoiding the first-person perspective and employing the third-person perspective in self-threatening memories. Genuine self-esteem predicted employing the first-person perspective regardless of the memories being self-threatening or self-boosting. In Experiment 2, narcissism predicted the third-person perspective, while genuine self-esteem predicted the first-person perspective when self-threatening memories were recalled. Neither narcissism, nor genuine self-esteem were associated with visual perspective when participants recalled negative memories irrelevant to the self. Results shed light on the role of self-evaluation in processing autobiographical memories.

P. Marcotti and P. L. St Jacques,2018,Shifting visual perspective during memory retrieval reduces the accuracy of subsequent memories,"Memories for events can be retrieved from visual perspectives that were never experienced, reflecting the dynamic and reconstructive nature of memories. Characteristics of memories can be altered when shifting from an own eyes perspective, the way most events are initially experienced, to an observer perspective, in which one sees oneself in the memory. Moreover, recent evidence has linked these retrieval-related effects of visual perspective to subsequent changes in memories. Here we examine how shifting visual perspective influences the accuracy of subsequent memories for complex events encoded in the lab. Participants performed a series of mini-events that were experienced from their own eyes, and were later asked to retrieve memories for these events while maintaining the own eyes perspective or shifting to an alternative observer perspective. We then examined how shifting perspective during retrieval modified memories by influencing the accuracy of recall on a final memory test. Across two experiments, we found that shifting visual perspective reduced the accuracy of subsequent memories and that reductions in vividness when shifting visual perspective during retrieval predicted these changes in the accuracy of memories. Our findings suggest that shifting from an own eyes to an observer perspective influences the accuracy of long-term memories.","Memory (Hove, England)",26,3,330-341,10.1080/09658211.2017.1329441

Using focal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and a social cognitive battery with differing demands on self-other processing, we demonstrate specific involvement of the dmPFC in tasks placing high demands on self-other processing. Specifically, excitatory (anodal) HD-tDCS enhanced the integration of external information into the self for explicit higher-order socio-cognitive tasks across cognitive domains; i.e. visual perspective taking (VPT) and episodic memory.

M. Martin and G. V. Jones,2012,Individualism and the field viewpoint: Cultural influences on memory perspective,"Two perspectives from which memories can be retrieved have been distinguished: field resembles the view from the first-person vantage point of original experience, whereas observer resembles the view from the third-person vantage point of a spectator. There is evidence that the incidences of the two types of perspective differ between at least two different cultural groups. It is hypothesised here that this is a special case of a more general relation between memory perspective and cultural individualism, such that field and observer perspectives are more prevalent among people from, respectively, relatively individualist and relatively collectivist societies. Memory perspectives adopted by participants from a range of different countries were recorded, and were found to vary in the predicted manner. Regression analysis showed that the potential effects of three other cultural variables - uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and, to a lesser extent, power distance - were eclipsed by the influence of individualism, and the implications are discussed.",Consciousness and Cognition,21,3,1498-1503,10.1016/j.concog.2012.04.009
"S. J. Martin, L. de Hoz and R. G. M. Morris",2005,"Retrograde amnesia: neither partial nor complete hippocampal lesions in rats result in preferential sparing of remote spatial memory, even after reminding","Many lesion experiments have provided evidence that the hippocampus plays a time-limited role in memory, consistent with the operation of a systems-level memory consolidation process during which lasting neocortical memory traces become established [see Squire, L. R., Clark, R. E., & Knowlton, B. J. (2001). Retrograde amnesia. Hippocampus 11, 50]. However, large lesions of the hippocampus at different time intervals after acquisition of a watermaze spatial reference memory task have consistently resulted in temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia [Bolhuis, J. J., Stewart, C. A., Forrest, E. M. (1994). Retrograde amnesia and memory reactivation in rats with ibotenate lesions to the hippocampus or subiculum.

P., Mumby, D., Astur, R. S., Hanlon, F. M., et al. (2001). Retrograde amnesia after hippocampal damage: recent vs. remote memories in two tasks. Hippocampus 11, 27]. It is possible that spatial memories acquired during such a task remain permanently dependent on the hippocampus, that chance performance may reflect a failure to access memory traces that are initially unexpressed but still present, or that graded retrograde amnesia for spatial information might only be observed following partial hippocampal lesions. This study examined the retrograde memory impairments of rats that received either partial or complete lesions of the hippocampus either 1-2 days, or 6 weeks after training in a watermaze reference memory task. Memory retention was assessed using a novel 'reminding' procedure consisting of a series of rewarded probe trials, allowing the measurement of both free recall and memory reactivation. Rats with complete hippocampal lesions exhibited stable, temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia, and could not be reminded of the correct location. Partially lesioned rats could be reminded of a recently learned platform location, but no recovery of remote memory was observed. These results offer no support for hippocampus-dependent consolidation of allocentric spatial information, and suggest that the hippocampus can play a long-lasting role in spatial memory. The nature of this role-in the storage, retrieval, or expression of memory-is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Of 389 neurons recorded from the monkey HF and PH, 166 had place fields that displayed increased activity in a specific area in the experimental field and/or on the monitor (location-differential neurons). More HF and PH neurons responded in the real translocation task. These neurons had low mean spontaneous firing rates (0.96 spikes/sec). The remaining nonresponsive neurons had significantly higher mean firing rates (8.39 spikes/sec). Furthermore, most location-differential neurons showed different responses in different tasks. These results suggest that the HF and PH are crucial in allocentric information processing and, moreover, that the HF can encode different reference frames that are context or task-dependent.

Roberts",2002,Relative sparing of item recognition memory in a patient with adult-onset damage limited to the hippocampus,"There is disagreement about whether selective hippocampal lesions in humans cause clear item recognition as well as recall deficits. Whereas Reed and Squire (Behav Neurosci 1997;111:667-775) found that patients with adult-onset relatively selective hippocampal lesions showed clear item recognition deficits, Vargha-Khadem et al. (Science 1997;277: 376-380, Soc Neurosci Abstr 1998;24:1523) found that 3 patients who suffered selective hippocampal damage in early childhood showed clear recall deficits, but had relatively normal item recognition. Manns and Squire (Hippocampus 1999;9:495-499) argued, however, that item recognition may have been spared in these patients because the early onset of their pathology allowed compensatory mechanisms to develop. Therefore, to determine whether early lesion onset is critical for the relative sparing of item recognition and to determine whether its occurrence is influenced by task factors, we extensively examined item recognition in patient Y.R., who has pathology of adult-onset restricted to the hippocampus. Like the developmental cases, she showed clear free recall deficits on 34 tests, but her item recognition on 43 tests was relatively spared, and markedly less disrupted than her recall. Her item recognition performance relative to that of her controls was not significantly influenced by whether tests tapped visual or verbal materials, had a yes/no or forced-choice format, contained few or many items, had one or several foils per target item, used short or very long delays, or were difficult or easy for normal subjects. Interestingly, YR's bilateral hippocampal destruction was greater than at least 2 of the 3 patients of Manns and Squire (Hippocampus 1999;9:495-499). The possible reasons why item recognition differs across patients with relatively selective hippocampal damage of adult-onset and how the reasons that are truly critical can be best identified are discussed.",Hippocampus,12,3,325-340,10.1002/hipo.1111

McCarroll,2017,Looking the past in the eye: Distortion in memory and the costs and benefits of recalling from an observer perspective,"Jordi Fernández (2015) discusses the possible benefits of two types of allegedly distorted memories: observer memories and fabricated memories. Fernández argues that even when memory does not preserve the past, some memories can still provide an adaptive benefit for the subject. I explore Fernández's claims focussing on the case of observer perspective memories. For Fernández, observer perspectives are distorted memories because they do not preserve past experience. In contrast, I suggest that observer perspectives can accurately reflect past experience: observer perspectives are not necessarily distorted memories. By looking at the complexity of the relation between remembering trauma from an observer perspective and emotional closure, I also sound a note of caution against Fernández's assertion that observer memories of trauma can be adaptively beneficial. Finally, I suggest that because observer perspectives are not necessarily distorted, but involve a distinct way of thinking about one's past, such memories can be epistemically beneficial.",Consciousness and cognition,49,,322-332,10.1016/j.concog.2017.01.014

We also examined the different viewpoints from which third-person perspective events were remembered or imagined. Although future events were somewhat more likely to be imagined from a third-person perspective, the spatial viewpoint distributions of third-person perspectives characterizing remembered and imagined events were highly similar. These results suggest that a similar constructive mechanism may be at work when people remember events from a perspective that could not have been experienced in the past and when they imagine events from a perspective that could not be experienced in the future.

Memories from an observer perspective involve seeing oneself in the original event as if from an external point of view; memories from a field perspective involve recalling the event as if viewing it through one's own eyes. Sixty-one patients with chronic pain were asked to (1) recall a painful memory, (2) indicate whether they saw themselves in the memory (observer mode) or re-experienced events of the memory from the first-person perspective (field mode), and (3) rate various phenomenologic properties of the memory. Twenty of these pain patients were also given two frontal lobe tests to examine potential neuropsychologic correlates of memory retrieval preferences. Memory retrieval in the field mode was associated with (a) significantly higher self-reported pain scores on the McGill Pain Questionnaire, (b) nonright-handedness, and (c) poorer performance on the tests of frontal function. Patients with chronic pain who adopt the field mode of memory retrieval when recalling painful memories experience greater current pain severity than chronic pain patients who adopt observer retrieval strategies. Those adopting field retrieval strategies may also evidence frontal system neuropsychologic anomalies.

As such, cognitive models predict that social anxiety should be associated with biases in the recall of social events. However, initial experimental studies examining this assumption either failed to find such biases or found only weak evidence for an autobiographical memory bias. The current review examines an emerging line of evidence offering support for the role of an autobiographical memory bias in the development and maintenance of social anxiety. The review begins by examining current theoretical approaches to autobiographical memory before looking at empirical studies that have examined differences between socially anxious and non-anxious individuals in the recall of autobiographical memories. Specific memory biases include properties of social-threat memories, the imagery associated with these memories, and the cognitive processing styles that have been found to either facilitate or inhibit the recall of emotional memories.

R. G. Morris and U. Frey,1997,Hippocampal synaptic plasticity: role in spatial learning or the automatic recording of attended experience?,"Allocentric spatial learning can sometimes occur in one trial. The incorporation of information into a spatial representation may, therefore, obey a one-trial correlational learning rule rather than a multi-trial error-correcting rule. It has been suggested that physiological implementation of such a rule could be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, as its induction obeys a correlational type of synaptic learning rule. Support for this idea came originally from the finding that intracerebral infusion of the NMDA antagonist AP5 impairs spatial learning, but studies summarized in the first part of this paper have called it into question. First, rats previously given experience of spatial learning in a watermaze can learn a new spatial reference memory task at a normal rate despite an appreciable NMDA receptor blockade. Second, the classical phenomenon of 'blocking' occurs in spatial learning. The latter finding implies that spatial learning can also be sensitive to an animal's expectations about reward and so depend on more than the detection of simple spatial correlations. In this paper a new hypothesis is proposed about the function of hippocampal LTP. This hypothesis retains the idea that LTP subserves rapid one-trial memory, but abandons the notion that it serves any specific role in the geometric aspects of spatial learning. It is suggested that LTP participates in the automatic recording of attended experience': a subsystem of episodic memory in which events are temporarily remembered in association with the contexts in which they occur. An automatic correlational form of synaptic plasticity is ideally suited to the online registration of context event associations. In support, it is reported that the ability of rats to remember the most recent place they have visited in a familiar environment is exquisitely sensitive to AP5 in a delay-dependent manner. Moreover, new studies of the lasting persistence of NMDA-dependent LTP, known to require protein synthesis, point to intracellular mechanisms that enable transient synaptic changes to be stabilized if they occur in close temporal proximity to important events. This new property of hippocampal LTP is a desirable characteristic of an event memory system.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

We examine episodic, semantic and spatial memory, and show that important distinctions exist among different types of these memories and the structures that mediate them. We argue that retention and retrieval of detailed, vivid autobiographical memories depend on the hippocampal system no matter how long ago they were acquired. Semantic memories, on the other hand, benefit from hippocampal contribution for some time before they can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus. Even semantic memories, however, can have episodic elements associated with them that continue to depend on the hippocampus. Likewise, we distinguish between experientially detailed spatial memories (akin to episodic memory) and more schematic memories (akin to semantic memory) that are sufficient for navigation but not for re-experiencing the environment in which they were acquired. Like their episodic and semantic counterparts, the former type of spatial memory is dependent on the hippocampus no matter how long ago it was acquired, whereas the latter can survive independently of the hippocampus and is represented in extra-hippocampal structures. In short, the evidence reviewed suggests strongly that the function of the hippocampus (and possibly that of related limbic structures) is to help encode, retain, and retrieve experiences, no matter how long ago the events comprising the experience occurred, and no matter whether the memories are episodic or spatial. We conclude that the evidence favours a multiple trace theory (MTT) of memory over two other models: (1) traditional consolidation models which posit that the hippocampus is a time-limited memory structure for all forms of memory; and (2) versions of cognitive map theory which posit that the hippocampus is needed for representing all forms of allocentric space in memory.",Journal of anatomy,207,1,35-66,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2005.00421.x

The factors also related differently to believability of positive versus negative thoughts, which was partially explained by the overrepresentation of negative items in the measures.

"S. F. Neggers, R. H. Van der Lubbe, N. F. Ramsey and A. Postma",2006,Interactions between ego- and allocentric neuronal representations of space,"In the primate brain, visual spatial representations express distances of objects with regard to different references. In the parietal cortex, distances are thought to be represented with respect to the body (egocentric representation) and in superior temporal cortices with respect to other objects, independent of the observer (allocentric representation). However, these representations of space are interdependent, complicating such distinctions. Specifically, an object's position within a background frame strongly biases egocentric position location judgments. This bias, however, is absent for pointing movements towards that same object. More recent theories state that dorsal parietal spatial representations subserve visuomotor processing, whereas temporal lobe representations subserve memory and cognition. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that parietal egocentric representations, responsible for movement control, are not influenced by irrelevant allocentric cues, whereas ventral representations are. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, subjects judged target bar locations relative to their body (egocentric task) or a background bar (allocentric task). Activity in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) was shown to increase during egocentric judgments, but not during allocentric judgments. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) shows a negative BOLD response during allocentric judgments and no activation during egocentric judgments. During egocentric judgments, the irrelevant background influenced activity in the posterior commissure and the medial temporal gyrus. SPL activity was unaffected by the irrelevant background during egocentric judgments. Sensitivity to spatial perceptual biases is apparently limited to occipito-temporal areas, subserving the observed biased cognitive reports of location, and is not found in parietal areas, subserving unbiased goal-directed actions.",Neuroimage,31,1,320-331,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.12.028

In Study 2, a concrete/imagery, abstract/verbal, and comparative/verbal processing style were compared. The processing of a personal memory in a concrete/imagery-based way led to a larger increase in positive affect compared to abstract/verbal processing in Study 1, as well as compared to comparative/verbal thinking in Study 2. Results of Study 2 further suggest that it is making unfavorable verbal comparisons that may hinder affective benefits to positive memories (rather than general abstract/verbal processing per se). The comparative/verbal thinking style failed to lead to improvements in positive affect, and with increasing levels of depressive symptoms it had a more negative impact on change in positive affect. We found no evidence that participant's tendency to have dampening thoughts in response to positive affect in daily life contributed to the affective impact of positive memory recall.

The results showed a small positive association between depressive symptoms and the use of an observer perspective for positive autobiographical memories, but not for negative memories. Furthermore, comparing a subgroup with clinically significant symptom levels (dysphoric students) with non-dysphoric individuals revealed that dysphoric students used an observer perspective more for positive memories compared with negative memories. This was not the case for non-dysphoric students.

G. Nigro and U. Neisser,1983,Point of view in personal memories,"Examined a structural aspect of personal memories in 4 studies with 60 college and 30 high school students. In some memories, one has the perspective of an observer, seeing oneself from the outside. In other memories, one sees the scene from one's own perspective; the field of view in such memories corresponds to that of the original situation. The existence of observer and field memories was confirmed in Study 1, using a recall questionnaire. In Study 2, the similarity structure of a specified set of 8 to-be-recalled situations was established: The significant dimensions were emotionality and self-awareness. Study 3 related these dimensions to the observer–field distinction; situations involving a high degree of emotion and self-awareness were most likely to be recalled with an observer perspective. Recall set was varied in Study 4: A focus on feelings, as opposed to objective circumstances, produced relatively more field memories. Studies 3 and 4 also showed that events reported as more recent tended to be recalled in the field mode. Thus, a qualitative characteristic of personal memories—the perspective from which they are experienced—is apparently related to characteristics of the original event, to the individual's purpose in recalling that event, and to the reported recall interval.

Maguire",1998,"Place cells, navigational accuracy, and the human hippocampus","The hippocampal formation in both rats and humans is involved in spatial navigation. In the rat, cells coding for places, directions, and speed of movement have been recorded from the hippocampus proper and/or the neighbouring subicular complex. Place fields of a group of the hippocampal pyramidal cells cover the surface of an environment but do not appear to do so in any systematic fashion. That is, there is no topographical relation between the anatomical location of the cells within the hippocampus and the place fields of these cells in an environment. Recent work shows that place cells are responding to the summation of two or more Gaussian curves, each of which is fixed at a given distance to two or more walls in the environment. The walls themselves are probably identified by their allocentric direction relative to the rat and this information may be provided by the head direction cells. The right human hippocampus retains its role in spatial mapping as demonstrated by its activation during accurate navigation in imagined and virtual reality environments. In addition, it may have taken on wider memory functions, perhaps by the incorporation of a linear time tag which allows for the storage of the times of visits to particular locations. This extended system would serve as the basis for a spatio-temporal event or episodic memory system.","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Neural activity in the monkey hippocampal formation (HF) was analyzed during a spatial moving task in which the monkey was guided by auditory and visual cues and when stimuli were presented from various directions. The monkey could control a motorized, movable device (cab) and its route to a target location by pressing the proper one of five available bars in an appropriate sequence (spatial moving task). In any of several locations in the field, neural responses were evident in relation to the presentation of various objects or human movement in some relative direction (left, anterior, right) as a directional stimulus test. 2. Of 238 hippocampal neurons analyzed, 172 (72.3%, 238-66) responded in either the spatial moving task, or to the direction from which stimulation was presented, or to the location of the monkey in the field, or to some combination of these. 3. The activity of 79 (33.2%) neurons was higher when the monkey was in some specific location in the field during the spatial moving task, regardless of the approach route or other task parameters (place related neurons). 4. Responses to the task cues in the spatial moving task were evident in 110 (46.3%) neurons (task related neurons). Of these, 77 (32.4%) neurons were not place related. The remaining 33 (13.9%) neurons were both task related and place related. These neurons responded to task cues in only that part of the field in which place related responses occurred. The neural response to the task cues disappeared when the monkey moved out of the place response region. The place related and task related neural responses disappeared when the room light was switched off. Thus information from the environment outside of the cab contributed to the place related and task related responses. 5. Stimuli presented from certain specific directions induced responses, selectively, in 41 (17.2%) of the neurons (direction related neurons). The dependence of the preferred direction was described in one of three ways--egocentric, allocentric, or place-direction specific. Nineteen egocentric neurons responded to a stimulus only when it was presented from a certain direction relative to the orientation of the monkey, regardless of the location of the monkey. Eleven allocentric neurons responded to a stimulus only when it was presented at a particular position in the room, regardless of the location or orientation of the monkey.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Journal of Neurophysiology,70,4,1516-1529,10.1152/jn.1993.70.4.1516

Such imagined past events are important aspects of mental life, affecting emotions, decisions, and behaviors. However, studies examining their phenomenological characteristics and content have been few. Here we introduced a new method to systematically compare self-generated episodic counterfactuals to self-generated episodic memories and future projections with regard to their phenomenological characteristics (e.g., imagery, emotional valence, and rehearsal) and content (e.g., reference to a cultural life script), and how these were affected by temporal distance (1 month, 1 year, 5+ years). The findings showed that the three types of events differed phenomenologically. First, episodic memories were remembered more easily, with more sensory details, and from a dominantly field perspective, as compared to both future projections and episodic counterfactuals. Second, episodic future projections were more positive, more voluntarily rehearsed, and more central to life story and identity than were both episodic memories and episodic counterfactuals. Third, episodic counterfactuals differed from both episodic memories and future projections by neither having the positivity bias of the future events nor the enhanced sensory details of the past events. Across all three event types, sensory details decreased, whereas importance, reference to a cultural life script, and centrality increased with increasing temporal distance. The findings show that imagined events are phenomenologically different from memories of experienced events, consistent with reality-monitoring theory, and that imagined future events are different from both actual and imagined past events, consistent with some theories of motivation.",Mem Cognit,45,3,375-389,10.3758/s13421-016-0671-2

Here we report data from three healthy, high functioning adults with the reverse pattern: lifelong severely deficient autobiographical memory (SDAM) with otherwise preserved cognitive function. Their self-reported selective inability to vividly recollect personally experienced events from a first-person perspective was corroborated by absence of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) biomarkers associated with naturalistic and laboratory episodic recollection, as well as by behavioral evidence of impaired episodic retrieval, particularly for visual information. Yet learning and memory were otherwise intact, as long as these tasks could be accomplished by non-episodic processes.

Here, we question the necessity of consciousness and hypothesize that humans can form unconscious episodic memories. Participants were presented with subliminal scenes, that is, scenes invisible to the conscious mind. The scenes displayed objects at certain locations for participants to form unconscious object-in-space memories. Later, the same scenes were presented supraliminally, that is, visibly, for retrieval testing. Scenes were presented absent the objects and rotated by 90 degrees -270 degrees in perspective to assess the representational flexibility of unconsciously formed memories. During the test phase, participants performed a forced-choice task that required them to place an object in one of two highlighted scene locations and their eye movements were recorded. Evaluation of the eye tracking data revealed that participants remembered object locations unconsciously, irrespective of changes in viewing perspective. This effect of gaze was related to correct placements of objects in scenes, and an intuitive decision style was necessary for unconscious memories to influence intentional behavior to a significant degree.

We assessed whether this generalizes to people with major depression (MD). Additionally, we assessed whether the emotion-reducing effects of adopting a third-person perspective also occur when subjects with MD and HC subjects analyze positive experiences. METHODS: Seventy-two MD subjects and 82 HC subjects analyzed a happy and a negative experience from either a first-person or a third-person perspective. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we found no emotion-reducing effects of third-person perspective in either group thinking about negative events. However, across groups, third-person perspective was associated with less recounting of negative experiences and with a clearer, more coherent understanding of them. Negative affect decreased and positive affect increased in both groups analyzing happy experiences. In MD subjects, decreases in depressive affect were stronger for the third-person perspective. In both groups, positive affect increased and negative affect decreased more strongly for the third-person perspective. LIMITATIONS: While reflecting on their positive memory, MD subjects adopted their assigned perspective for a shorter amount of time (70%) than HC subjects (78%). However, percentage of time participants adopted their assigned perspective was unrelated to the significant effects we found.

Eustache",2007,"Autobiographical memory, the sense of recollection and executive functions after severe traumatic brain injury","Residual disorders of autobiographical memory long after trauma resulting from head injury are rarely assessed, even though they may affect social adjustment and the resumption of daily life. We conducted a thorough study of autobiographical memory in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, examined at least one year post-trauma. Twenty-five patients were submitted to a novel and controlled autobiographical procedure specially designed to measure episodic memories (i.e., unique, specific in time and space, and detailed) from their entire life span with two kinds of self-remembering experience. The ability to mentally travel back through time and re-experience the source of acquisition, i.e. autonoetic consciousness, was assessed via the Remember/Know paradigm and a checking procedure of sense of remembering. Self-perspective in visual imagery, which is also critically involved in episodic recollection, was assessed by the Field/Observer perspective paradigm. In addition, the patients underwent a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests to assess episodic and semantic memory, orientation and executive functions. The results showed that the patients, compared with healthy controls, were significantly impaired in recalling episodic autobiographical memories. This impairment was not related to the life period tested or the patients' ages nor the intellectual impairment. Deficits involved disturbances in sense of remembering, visual imagery self-perspective and recollection of spatiotemporal details. Stepwise-regression analyses carried out in the TBI patients revealed a significant relationship between an abnormal sense of remembering and executive dysfunction covering both anterograde and retrograde components. The novel assessment used in this study provides the first detailed evidence of a more fine-grained deficit of autobiographical memory in TBI patients. Indeed, the results suggest that these patients, long after trauma, present autonoetic consciousness and self-perspective disorders, which include sense of identity (the self) as a continuous entity across time, probably related to frontal dysfunction.

Piolino",2012,Using virtual reality to characterize episodic memory profiles in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: Influence of active and passive encoding,"Most neuropsychological assessments of episodic memory bear little similarity to the events that patients actually experience as memories in daily life. The first aim of this study was to use a virtual environment to characterize episodic memory profiles in an ecological fashion, which includes memory for central and perceptual details, spatiotemporal contextual elements, and binding. This study included subjects from three different populations: healthy older adults, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and patients with early to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Second, we sought to determine whether environmental factors that can affect encoding (active vs. passive exploration) influence memory performance in pathological aging. Third, we benchmarked the results of our virtual reality episodic memory test against a classical memory test and a subjective daily memory complaint scale. Here, the participants were successively immersed in two virtual environments; the first, as the driver of a virtual car (active exploration) and the second, as the passenger of that car (passive exploration). Subjects were instructed to encode all elements of the environment as well as the associated spatiotemporal contexts. Following each immersion, we assessed the patient’s recall and recognition of central information (i.e., the elements of the environment), contextual information (i.e., temporal, egocentric and allocentric spatial information) and lastly, the quality of binding. We found that the AD patients’ performances were inferior to that of the aMCI and even more to that of the healthy aged groups, in line with the progression of hippocampal atrophy reported in the literature. Spatial allocentric memory assessments were found to be particularly useful for distinguishing aMCI patients from healthy older adults. Active exploration yielded enhanced recall of central and allocentric spatial information, as well as binding in all groups. This led aMCI patients to achieve better performance scores on immediate temporal memory tasks. Finally, the patients’ daily memory complaints were more highly correlated with the performances on the virtual test than with their performances on the classical memory test. Taken together, these results highlight specific cognitive differences found between these three populations that may provide additional insight into the early diagnosis and rehabilitation of pathological aging. In particular, neuropsychological studies would benefit to use virtual tests and a multi-component approach to assess episodic memory, and encourage active encoding of information in patients suffering from mild or severe age-related memory impairment. The beneficial effect of active encoding on episodic memory in aMCI and early to moderate AD is discussed in the context of relatively preserved frontal and motor brain functions implicated in self-referential effects and procedural abilities.

In most cases, the objects hidden underneath the bubbles were in the same place as on day 1. However, a varying third of them were misplaced in each block. Subjects indicated their certainty that the object was in the same location as the day before. Compared with bubble pops revealing correctly placed objects, bubble pops revealing misplaced objects evoked a decreased negativity starting at 145 ms, with scalp topography consistent with generation in medial parietal cortex. There was also an increased negativity starting at 515 ms to misplaced objects, with scalp topography consistent with generation in inferior temporal cortex. Additionally, misplaced objects elicited an increase in frontal midline theta power. These findings suggest that the successive neurocognitive stages of processing allocentric space may include an initial template matching, integration of the object within its spatial cognitive map, and memory recall, analogous to the processing negativity N400 and theta that support verbal cognitive maps in humans.",J Neurophysiol,113,3,740-753,10.1152/jn.00114.2014

Our results revealed greater delay-epoch activity in egocentric than in allocentric trials in the caudate nucleus and trends in the same direction in the putamen and the lateral premotor cortex (PMC). Response-related activity was greater for egocentric trials in the lateral PMC. We propose that the neostriatum, possibly interacting with the PMC, may contribute to the sensory-motor transformation necessary to establish a prospective motor code (e.g., the representation of a saccade or a grasp). In addition, the PMC may participate in decision-making processes, prompted by the onset of the probe stimulus, that employ this prospective motor information.

Several autobiographical memory deficits, including low specificity of personal memories, have been identified in schizophrenia, but visual perspective during autobiographical memory retrieval has not yet been investigated in patients. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the visual perspective with which patients visualize themselves when recalling autobiographical memories and to assess the specificity of their memories which is a major determinant of visual perspective. Thirty patients with schizophrenia and 30 matched controls recalled personal events from 4 life periods. After each recall, they were asked to report their visual perspective (Field or Observer) associated with the event. The specificity of their memories was assessed by independent raters. Our results showed that patients reported significantly fewer Field perspectives than comparison participants. Patients' memories, whether recalled with Field or Observer perspectives, were less specific and less detailed. Our results indicate that patients with schizophrenia adopt Field perspectives less frequently than comparison participants, and that this may contribute to a weakened sense of the individual of being an actor of his past events, and hence to a reduced sense of self. They suggest that this may be related to low specificity of memories and that all the important aspects involved in re-experiencing autobiographical events are impaired in patients with schizophrenia.

Its early decline is symptomatic for elderly dementia. Substances that selectively reduce alpha5-GABA(A) receptor function are currently developed as potential cognition enhancers for Alzheimer's syndrome and other dementia, consistent with genetic studies implicating these receptors that are highly expressed in hippocampus in learning performance. Here we explored the consequences of reduced GABA(A)alpha5-subunit contents, as occurring in alpha5(H105R) knock-in mice, on the memory for location of objects. This required the behavioral characterization of alpha5(H105R) and wild-type animals in various tasks examining learning and memory retrieval strategies for objects, locations, contexts and their combinations. In mutants, decreased amounts of alpha5-subunits and retained long-term potentiation in hippocampus were confirmed. They exhibited hyperactivity with conserved circadian rhythm in familiar actimeters, and normal exploration and emotional reactivity in novel places, allocentric spatial guidance, and motor pattern learning acquisition, inhibition and flexibility in T- and eight-arm mazes. Processing of object, position and context memories and object-guided response learning were spared. Genotype difference in object-in-place memory retrieval and in encoding and response learning strategies for object-location combinations manifested as a bias favoring object-based recognition and guidance strategies over spatial processing of objects in the mutants. These findings identify in alpha5(H105R) mice a behavioral-cognitive phenotype affecting basal locomotion and the memory for location of objects indicative of hippocampal dysfunction resulting from moderately decreased alpha5-subunit contents.","Genes, brain, and behavior",9,5,478-488,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2010.00575.x

Experiment 2 found that with lessened task demands, and by using a scale of doubt, participants distinguished lies from truthful statements (albeit with a degree of error). Over the two experiments, results indicated that people have some ability to distinguish lies from truth (in illusion-of-transparency tasks), although people often overestimate this ability, and participants sometimes think their own lies are easier to detect than is really the case.

For example, time-based control has been found in rats only when tested in a T-maze apparatus and under specific conditions in which position and orientation (i.e., egocentric) cues during the intertrial interval could not be used to aid performance. Other research in an operant setting has shown that rats often produce minimal errors around the reversal location, demonstrating response patterns similar to patterns exhibited by humans and primates in this task. The current study aimed to reduce, but not eliminate, the ability for rats to utilize egocentric cues by placing the response levers on the opposite wall of the chamber in relation to the pellet dispenser. Results showed that rats made minimal errors prior to the reversal, suggesting time-based cues were not controlling responses, and that they switched to the second correct stimulus within a few trials after the reversal event. Video recordings also revealed highly structured patterns of behavior by the majority of rats, which often differed depending on which response was reinforced. We interpret these findings as evidence that rats are adept at utilizing their own egocentric cues and that these cues, along with memory for the recent response-reinforcement contingencies, aid in maximizing reinforcement over the session.",Behav Processes,152,,10-17,

Mizumori",2015,A role for the lateral dorsal tegmentum in memory and decision neural circuitry,"A role for the hippocampus in memory is clear, although the mechanism for its contribution remains a matter of debate. Converging evidence suggests that hippocampus evaluates the extent to which context-defining features of events occur as expected. The consequence of mismatches, or prediction error, signals from hippocampus is discussed in terms of its impact on neural circuitry that evaluates the significance of prediction errors: Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine cells burst fire to rewards or cues that predict rewards (Schultz, Dayan, & Montague, 1997). Although the lateral dorsal tegmentum (LDTg) importantly controls dopamine cell burst firing (Lodge & Grace, 2006) the behavioral significance of the LDTg control is not known. Therefore, we evaluated LDTg functional activity as rats performed a spatial memory task that generates task-dependent reward codes in VTA (Jo, Lee, & Mizumori, 2013; Puryear, Kim, & Mizumori, 2010) and another VTA afferent, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPTg, Norton, Jo, Clark, Taylor, & Mizumori, 2011). Reversible inactivation of the LDTg significantly impaired choice accuracy. LDTg neurons coded primarily egocentric information in the form of movement velocity, turning behaviors, and behaviors leading up to expected reward locations. A subset of the velocity-tuned LDTg cells also showed high frequency bursts shortly before or after reward encounters, after which they showed tonic elevated firing during consumption of small, but not large, rewards. Cells that fired before reward encounters showed stronger correlations with velocity as rats moved toward, rather than away from, rewarded sites. LDTg neural activity was more strongly regulated by egocentric behaviors than that observed for PPTg or VTA cells that were recorded by Puryear et al. and Norton et al. While PPTg activity was uniquely sensitive to ongoing sensory input, all three regions encoded reward magnitude (although in different ways), reward expectation, and reward encounters. Only VTA encoded reward prediction errors. LDTg may inform VTA about learned goal-directed movement that reflects the current motivational state, and this in turn may guide VTA determination of expected subjective goal values. When combined it is clear the LDTg and PPTg provide only a portion of the information that dopamine cells need to assess the value of prediction errors, a process that is essential to future adaptive decisions and switches of cognitive (i.e. memorial) strategies and behavioral responses.",Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,117,,93-108,10.1016/j.nlm.2014.05.009
"C. Repetto, S. Serino, M. Macedonia and G. Riva",2016,Virtual reality as an embodied tool to enhance episodic memory in elderly,"This article discusses the the use of virtual reality (VR) as an innovative tool to support episodic memory in older adults. Virtual reality allows users to create, explore and interact within environments that are perceived as near to reality. Typically, users entering a VR lab feel as being a part of this world and behave as if they were in the real world. Specifically, even if users do not always move their bodies in the real space, users have the subjective perception of being “in action.” Three main features that VR implements may have an impact on episodic memory in elderly: First VR allows to experience from an egocentric point of view. Second, VR allows active navigation while the user actively explores the environment by manipulating keyboards, joysticks, or controllers. Third, VR provides environmental enrichment by using flexible scenarios. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",Frontiers in Psychology,7,,4,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01839

Lavenex",2013,Development of allocentric spatial memory abilities in children from 18 months to 5 years of age,"Episodic memories for autobiographical events that happen in unique spatiotemporal contexts are central to defining who we are. Yet, before 2 years of age, children are unable to form or store episodic memories for recall later in life, a phenomenon known as infantile amnesia. Here, we studied the development of allocentric spatial memory, a fundamental component of episodic memory, in two versions of a real-world memory task requiring 18 month- to 5-year-old children to search for rewards hidden beneath cups distributed in an open-field arena. Whereas children 25-42-months-old were not capable of discriminating three reward locations among 18 possible locations in absence of local cues marking these locations, children older than 43 months found the reward locations reliably. These results support previous findings suggesting that allocentric spatial memory, if present, is only rudimentary in children under 3.5 years of age. However, when tested with only one reward location among four possible locations, children 25-39-months-old found the reward reliably in absence of local cues, whereas 18-23-month-olds did not. Our findings thus show that the ability to form a basic allocentric representation of the environment is present by 2 years of age, and its emergence coincides temporally with the offset of infantile amnesia. However, the ability of children to distinguish and remember closely related spatial locations improves from 2 to 3.5 years of age, a developmental period marked by persistent deficits in long-term episodic memory known as childhood amnesia. These findings support the hypothesis that the differential maturation of distinct hippocampal circuits contributes to the emergence of specific memory processes during early childhood.",Cogn Psychol,66,1,1-29,10.1016/j.cogpsych.2012.08.001

Whereas basic allocentric spatial memory abilities are reliably observed in children after 2 years of age, coinciding with the offset of infantile amnesia, the resolution of allocentric spatial memory acquired over repeated trials improves from 2 to 4 years of age. Here, we first show that single-trial allocentric spatial memory performance improves in children from 3.5 to 7 years of age, during the typical period of childhood amnesia. Second, we show that large individual variation exists in children's performance at this age. Third, and most importantly, we show that improvements in single-trial allocentric spatial memory performance are due to an increasing ability to spatially and temporally separate locations and events. Such improvements in spatial and temporal processing abilities may contribute to the gradual offset of childhood amnesia.",Developmental psychobiology,59,2,185-196,
H. J. Rice and D. C. Rubin,2009,I can see it both ways: First- and third-person visual perspectives at retrieval,"The number of studies examining visual perspective during retrieval has recently grown. However, the way in which perspective has been conceptualized differs across studies. Some studies have suggested perspective is experienced as either a first-person or a third-person perspective, whereas others have suggested both perspectives can be experienced during a single retrieval attempt. This aspect of perspective was examined across three studies, which used different measurement techniques commonly used in studies of perspective. Results suggest that individuals can experience more than one perspective when recalling events. Furthermore, the experience of the two perspectives correlated differentially with ratings of vividness, suggesting that the two perspectives should not be considered in opposition of one another. We also found evidence of a gender effect in the experience of perspective, with females experiencing third-person perspectives more often than males. Future studies should allow for the experience of more than one perspective during retrieval. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Using a novel technique to measure visual perspective, we examined where the external vantage point is situated in third-person images. Individuals in two studies were asked to recall either 10 or 15 events from their lives and describe the perspectives they experienced. Wide variation in spatial locations was observed within third-person perspectives, with the location of these perspectives relating to the event being recalled.

E. L. Rich and M. Shapiro,2009,Rat prefrontal cortical neurons selectively code strategy switches,"Multiple memory systems are distinguished by different sets of neuronal circuits and operating principles optimized to solve different problems across mammalian species (Tulving and Schacter, 1994). When a rat selects an arm in a plus maze, for example, the choice can be guided by distinct neural systems (White and Wise, 1999) that encode different relationships among perceived stimuli, actions, and reward. Thus, egocentric or stimulus-response associations require striatal circuits, whereas spatial or episodic learning requires hippocampal circuits (Packard et al., 1989). Although these memory systems function in parallel (Packard and McGaugh, 1996), they can also interact competitively or synergistically (Kim and Ragozzino, 2005). The neuronal mechanisms that coordinate these multiple memory systems are not fully known, but converging evidence suggests that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central. The PFC is crucial for abstract, rule-guided behavior in primates and for switching rapidly between memory strategies in rats. We now report that rat medial PFC neuronal activity predicts switching between hippocampus- and caudate-dependent memory strategies. Prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) neuronal activity changed as rats switched memory strategies even as the rats performed identical behaviors but did not change when rats learned new contingencies using the same strategy. PL dynamics anticipated learning performance whereas IL lagged, suggesting that the two regions help initiate and establish new strategies, respectively. These neuronal dynamics suggest that the PFC contributes to the coordination of memory strategies by integrating the predictive relationships among stimuli, actions, and reward.",J Neurosci,29,22,7208-7219,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6068-08.2009
G. Riva,2014,Out of my real body: Cognitive neuroscience meets eating disorders,"Clinical psychology is starting to explain eating disorders (ED) as the outcome of the interaction among cognitive, socio-emotional and interpersonal elements. In particular two influential models—the revised cognitive-interpersonal maintenance model and the transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral theory—identified possible key predisposing and maintaining factors. These models, even if very influential and able to provide clear suggestions for therapy, still are not able to provide answers to several critical questions: why do not all the individuals with obsessive compulsive features, anxious avoidance or with a dysfunctional scheme for self-evaluation develop an ED? What is the role of the body experience in the etiology of these disorders? In this paper we suggest that the path to a meaningful answer requires the integration of these models with the recent outcomes of cognitive neuroscience. First, our bodily representations are not just a way to map an external space but the main tool we use to generate meaning, organize our experience, and shape our social identity. In particular, we will argue that our bodily experience evolves over time by integrating six different representations of the body characterized by specific pathologies—body schema (phantom limb), spatial body (unilateral hemi-neglect), active body (alien hand syndrome), personal body (autoscopic phenomena), objectified body (xenomelia) and body image (body dysmorphia). Second, these representations include either schematic (allocentric) or perceptual (egocentric) contents that interact within the working memory of the individual through the alignment between the retrieved contents from long-term memory and the ongoing egocentric contents from perception. In this view EDs may be the outcome of an impairment in the ability of updating a negative body representation stored in autobiographical memory (allocentric) with real-time sensorimotor and proprioceptive data (egocentric).

G. Riva,2016,Neurobiology of anorexia nervosa: Serotonin dysfunctions link self-starvation with body image disturbances through an impaired body memory,"The etiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) is still unclear, despite that it is a critical and potentially mortal illness. A recent neurobiological model considers AN as the outcome of dysfunctions in the neuronal processes related to appetite and emotionality (Kaye et al., 2009, 2013). However, this model still is not able to answer a critical question: What is behind body image disturbances (BIDs) in AN? The article starts its analysis from reviewing some of the studies exploring the effects of the serotonin systems in memory (episodic, working, and spatial) and its dysfunctions. The review suggests that serotonin disturbances may: (a) facilitate the encoding of third person (allocentric) episodic memories; (b) facilitate the consolidation of emotional episodic memories (e.g., teasing), if preceded by repeated stress; (c) reduce voluntary inhibition of mnestic contents; (d) impair allocentric spatial memory. If we discuss these results within the interpretative frame suggested by the “Allocentric Lock Hypothesis” (Riva, 2012, 2014), we can hypothesize that altered serotoninergic activity in AN patients: (i) improves their ability to store and consolidate negative autobiographical memories, including those of their body, in allocentric perspective; (ii) impairs their ability to trigger voluntary inhibition of the previously stored negative memory of the body; (iii) impairs their capacity to retrieve/update allocentric information. Taken together, these points suggest a possible link between serotonin dysfunctions, memory impairments and BIDs: the impossibility of updating a disturbed body memory using real time experiential data—I’m locked to a wrong body stored in long term memory—pushes AN patients to control body weight and shape even when underweight.

Dakanalis,2018,Altered Processing and Integration of Multisensory Bodily Representations and Signals in Eating Disorders: A Possible Path Toward the Understanding of Their Underlying Causes,"According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) eating problems are the clinical core of eating disorders (EDs). However, the importance of shape and weight overvaluation symptoms in these disorders underlines the critical role of the experience of the body in the etiology of EDs. This article suggests that the transdiagnostic centrality of these symptoms in individuals with EDs may reflect a deficit in the processing and integration of multisensory bodily representations and signals. Multisensory body integration is a critical cognitive and perceptual process, allowing the individual to protect and extend her/his boundaries at both the homeostatic and psychological levels. To achieve this goal the brain integrates sensory data arriving from real-time multiple sensory modalities and internal bodily information with predictions made using the stored information about the body from conceptual, perceptual, and episodic memory. In this view the emotional, visual, tactile, proprioceptive and interoceptive deficits reported by many authors in individuals with EDs may reflect a broader impairment in multisensory body integration that affects the individual's abilities: (a) to identify the relevant interoceptive signals that predict potential pleasant (or aversive) consequences; and (b) to modify/correct the autobiographical allocentric (observer view) memories of body related events (self-objectified memories). Based on this view, the article also proposes a strategy, based on new technologies (i.e., virtual reality and brain/body stimulation), for using crossmodal associations to reactivate and correct the multisensory body integration processes.",Frontiers in human neuroscience,12,,49,10.3389/fnhum.2018.00049

According to the Allocentric Lock Hypothesis--ALH (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2011.10.039) individuals with AN may be locked to an allocentric (observer view) negative memory of the body that is no more updated by contrasting egocentric representations driven by perception.

However, research suggests that events inciting guilt or shame may be associated with PTSD. We devised a web-based survey in which non-clinical participants identified an event associated with shame or guilt and completed questionnaire measures of shame, guilt, PTSD, and depression. In addition, we assessed characteristics of memory for the event, including visual perspective and the centrality of the memory to the participant's autobiographical narrative (CES). Shame predicted depression and PTSD symptoms. There was no association between guilt and psychological symptoms after controlling statistically for the effects of shame. CES predicted the severity of depression and PTSD symptoms. In addition, CES mediated the moderating effect of visual perspective on the relationship between emotional intensity and PTSD symptoms. Our results suggest shame is capable of eliciting the intrusive and distressing memories characteristic of PTSD. Furthermore, our results suggest aversive emotional events are associated with psychological distress when memory for those events becomes central to one's identity and autobiographical narrative.",Behaviour research and therapy,48,7,646-652,10.1016/j.brat.2010.03.017

The affect experienced decreased when shifting from a field to an observer perspective, but did not change with the converse shift.

These different anatomical-clinical subtypes can be associated or dissociated. They reflect the heterogeneity of this unilateral neglect syndrome that cannot be approached or interpreted in a single manner. We propose that these subtypes result from different underlying deficits: exogenous attentional deficit (visual, auditory neglect); representational deficit (personal neglect, representational neglect, hyperschematia); shift of the egocentric reference frame (egocentric neglect); attentional deficit between objects and within objects (allocentric neglect), endogenous attentional deficit (representational neglect) and transsaccadic working memory or spatial remapping deficit (ipsilesional productive manifestations).

Using a conceptual referential communication task, in which participants describe a range of abstract geometric shapes, Experiment 1 shows that perspective-taking and egocentric communication are frequent communication strategies. Experiment 2 tests a selection heuristic account of perspective-taking and egocentric communication. It uses participants' shape description ratings to predict their communication strategy. Participants' communication strategy was predicted by how informative they perceived the different shape descriptions to be. When participants' personal shape description was perceived to be more informative than their addressee's shape description, there was a strong bias to communicate egocentrically. By contrast, when their addressee's shape description was perceived to be more informative, there was a strong bias to take their addressee's perspective. When the shape descriptions were perceived to be equally informative, there was a moderate bias to communicate egocentrically. This simple, but powerful, selection heuristic may be critical to the cumulative cultural evolution of human communication systems, and cumulative cultural evolution more generally.",PLoS One,11,7,e0159570,10.1371/journal.pone.0159570

Information represented in the primate hippocampus was analyzed by making recordings in monkeys actively walking. In a sample of 352 cells recorded, no place cells were found, but a considerable population of spatial view cells were found that tuned to respond when the monkey looked at small parts of the environment. Research has demonstrated: (1) these hippocampal neurons respond to a view of space, not to the monkey's location; (2) responses depend on where the monkey is looking; (3) responses in some cases (e.g., CA1 but not CA3) still occur if view details are obscured; (4) cells retain part of their space tuning even in darkness, for several minutes; and (5) spatial representation is allocentric. This representation of space by primate spatial view cells would be an appropriate part of a system involved in memories of particular episodes of where in an environment an object was seen. Spatial view cells (in conjunction with whole body motion cells in the primate hippocampus, and head direction cells in the primate presubiculum) would also be useful as a memory component in a spatial navigation system.

Recordings were made from single hippocampal formation neurons while macaques performed an object-place memory task that required the monkeys to learn associations between objects and where they were shown in a room. Some neurons (10%) responded differently to different objects independently of location; other neurons (13%) responded to the spatial view independently of which object was present at the location; and some neurons (12%) responded to a combination of a particular object and the place where it was shown in the room. These results show that there are separate as well as combined representations of objects and their locations in space in the primate hippocampus. This is a property required in an episodic memory system, for which associations between objects and the places where they are seen are prototypical. The results thus provide an important advance by showing that a requirement for a human episodic memory system, separate and combined neuronal representations of objects and where they are seen out there in the environment, is present in the primate hippocampus.

Studies of patients with adult-onset lesions lend support to these distinctions for newly encountered places but suggest that with time and/or experience, schematic aspects of environments can exist independent of the hippocampus. Less clear is the quality of spatial memories acquired in individuals with impaired episodic memory in the context of a hippocampal system that did not develop normally. Here we describe a detailed investigation of the integrity of spatial representations of environments navigated repeatedly over many years in the rare case of H.C., a person with congenital absence of the mammillary bodies and abnormal hippocampal and fornix development. H.C. and controls who had extensive experience navigating the residential and downtown areas known to H.C. were tested on mental navigation tasks that assess the identity, location, and spatial relations among landmarks, and the ability to represent routes. H.C. was able to represent distances and directions between familiar landmarks and provide accurate, though inefficient, route descriptions. However, difficulties producing detailed spatial features on maps and accurately ordering more than two landmarks that are in close proximity to one another along a route suggest a spatial representation that includes only coarse, schematic information that lacks coherence and that cannot be used flexibly. This pattern of performance is considered in the context of other areas of preservation and impairment exhibited by H.C. and suggests that the allocentric-egocentric dichotomy with respect to hippocampal and extended hippocampal system function may need to be reconsidered.",Frontiers in human neuroscience,9,,196,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00196

In his spatial knowledge, general aspects were preserved, but details were lost, a pattern that resembled his memory loss in other domains. K.C. performed normally on allocentric spatial tests of his neighborhood and the world. He had difficulty, however, in recognizing and identifying non-salient neighborhood landmarks, and in recognizing city locations on world maps.

Here, we examine brain activity with fMRI during the retrieval of spatial information in K.C. and in healthy controls using landmark and route stimuli from a premorbidly familiar neighborhood that K.C. can navigate normally. In all participants, activity was found in the parahippocampal cortex, but not in the hippocampus itself, during all navigational tasks on which K.C. performs well, even though part of his hippocampus remains viable. The opposite pattern was observed on a house recognition task, which is inconsequential to navigation, and on which K.C. performed poorly. On that task, K.C. recruited the right hippocampus presumably because even familiar houses were treated as novel by him, whereas controls recruited occipitotemporal cortex, including parahippocampal cortex.

Such preservation may rely, instead, on a network of dissociable, extra-hippocampal regions implicated in topographical orientation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated this hypothesis in healthy individuals with extensive experience navigating in a large-scale urban environment (downtown Toronto). Participants were scanned as they performed mental navigation tasks that emphasized different types of spatial representations. Tasks included proximity judgments, distance judgments, landmark sequencing, and blocked-route problem-solving. The following regions were engaged to varying degrees depending on the processing demands of each task: retrosplenial cortex, believed to be involved in assigning directional significance to locales within a relatively allocentric framework; medial and posterior parietal cortex, concerned with processing space within egocentric coordinates during imagined movement; and regions of prefrontal cortex, present in tasks heavily dependent on working memory. In a second, event-related experiment, a distinct area of inferotemporal cortex was revealed during identification of familiar landmarks relative to unknown buildings in addition to activation of many of those regions identified in the navigation tasks. This result suggests that familiar landmarks are strongly integrated with the spatial context in which they were experienced. Importantly, right medial temporal lobe activity was observed, its magnitude equivalent across all tasks, though the core of the activated region was in the parahippocampal gyrus, barely touching the hippocampus proper.",Hippocampus,14,7,826-835,DOI 10.1002/hipo.10218

This relative anosognosia of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients for personality changes might be related to impaired self-judgment and to decreased ability to understand their caregiver's perspective. To investigate this issue, we explored the cerebral correlates of self-assessment and perspective taking in patients with mild AD, elderly and young volunteers. All subjects assessed relevance of personality traits adjectives for self and a relative, taking either their own or their relative's perspective, during a functional imaging experiment. The comparison of subject's and relative's answers provided congruency scores used to assess self-judgment and perspective taking performance. The self-judgment accuracy score was diminished in AD, and when patients assessed adjectives for self-relevance, they predominantly activated bilateral intraparietal sulci (IPS). Previous studies associated IPS activation with familiarity judgment, which AD patients would use more than recollection when retrieving information to assess self-personality. When taking a third-person perspective, patients activated prefrontal regions (similarly to young volunteers), while elderly controls recruited visual associative areas (also activated by young volunteers).

Next, animals of a second group learned in a two-alternative choice paradigm to discriminate between two colours, whereas a third group solved a spatial cognition task in an open-field maze by use of an ego-allocentric strategy. After memory acquisition and consolidation, animals were pharmacologically treated using the treatment regime as in the first group and then tested again for memory retrieval.RESULTSWe found an enhanced Erk but not Akt phosphorylation suggesting that THC treatment specifically activated Erk signalling in the zebrafish telencephalon. While CB1 agonist THC did not affect behavioural performance of animals in the colour discrimination paradigm, spatial memory was significantly impaired. The effect of THC on spatial learning is probably specific, since neither motor activity nor anxiety-related behaviour was influenced by the drug treatment. That indicates a striking influence of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) on spatial cognition in zebrafish.CONCLUSIONSThe results are very coincident with reports on mammals, demonstrating that the ECS is functional highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. We further conclude that the zebrafish provides a promising model organism for ongoing research on the ECS.",Psychopharmacology,231,19,3829-3842,
J. Russell,2014,"Episodic memory as re-experiential memory: Kantian, developmental, and neuroscientific currents","Recent work on the early development of episodic memory in my laboratory has been fuelled by the following assumption: if episodic memory is re-experiential memory then Kant’s analysis of the spatiotemporal nature of experience should constrain and positively influence theories of episodic memory development. The idea is that re-experiential memory will “inherit” these spatiotemporal features. On the basis of this assumption, Russell and Hanna ( Mind and Language 27(1):29–54, 2012) proposed that (a) the spatial element of re-experience is egocentric and (b) that the temporal element of re-experiencing involves order/simultaneity. The first of these assumptions is immediately problematic for two reasons. In the first place, if we assume that early episodic recall mediated by processing in the hippocampus, then (a) is clearly in tension with the fact that spatial coding in the hippocampus is allocentric/environment-centred. Second, two of our own recent experiments (described here) show that when only egocentric cues are available in a What/When/Where episodic memory task it is not possible to distinguish young children’s performance from semantic memory. I argue that this tension should be resolved by recognising that the egocentric coding of the original experience as being of an objective scene relies upon allocentric representations and these are preserved in re-experiential memory, allowing a recollection of the objective nature of the scene on which one takes a subjective view.

R. B. Sanitioso,2008,Motivated self and recall: Visual perspectives in remembering past behaviors,"The present study examined motivational influences on visual perspectives in remembering past events and behaviors. Participants were first induced to believe that extraversion or introversion is conducive of success. Next, they recalled in details two introverted past behaviors. Introversion-success participants, presumably motivated to see themselves as introverted, recalled and visualized the behaviors more from a first-person actor perspective than did extraversion-success participants (who recalled the behaviors from a third-person observer perspective). Remembering past behaviors from a first-person actor perspective implies that the behaviors are true of the self and impacts self-definition to a relatively greater degree. The findings thus extend the influence of desired self to how people remember past events. They also contribute to the integration of motives in research on the link between self-inferences and the subjective experience of remembering.

Klotzbier",2016,Cognitive-motor interference during fine and gross motor tasks in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD),"BACKGROUND: While typically developing children produce relatively automatized postural control processes, children with DCD seem to exhibit an automatization deficit. Dual tasks with various cognitive loads seem to be an effective way to assess the automatic deficit hypothesis. AIMS: The aims of the study were: (1) to examine the effect of a concurrent cognitive task on fine and gross motor tasks in children with DCD, and (2) to determine whether the effect varied with different difficulty levels of the concurrent task. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We examined dual-task performance (Trail-Making-Test, Trail-Walking-Test) in 20 children with DCD and 39 typically developing children. Based on the idea of the Trail-Making-Test, participants walked along a fixed pathway, following a prescribed path, delineated by target markers of (1) increasing sequential numbers, and (2) increasing sequential numbers and letters. The motor and cognitive dual-task effects (DTE) were calculated for each task. RESULTS: Regardless of the cognitive task, children with DCD performed equally well in fine and gross motor tasks, and were slower in the dual task conditions than under single task-conditions, compared with children without DCD. Increased cognitive task complexity resulted in slow trail walking as well as slower trail tracing. The motor interference for the gross motor tasks was least for the simplest conditions and greatest for the complex conditions and was more pronounced in children with DCD. Cognitive interference was low irrespective of the motor task. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Children with DCD show a different approach to allocation of cognitive resources, and have difficulties making motor skills automatic. The latter notion is consistent with impaired cerebellar function and the automatization deficit hypothesis, suggesting that any deficit in the automatization process will appear if conscious monitoring of the motor skill is made more difficult by integrating another task requiring attentional resources.",Res Dev Disabil,57,,136-148,10.1016/j.ridd.2016.07.003

In the present study, we examined whether this effect has a long duration by employing follow-up measurements. The participants were asked to recall the same events repeatedly across three sessions (S1, S2, and S3): S2 was conducted about three days after S1, and S3 was conducted about four weeks after S2. The results showed a reduction in the emotional intensity of the recalled events when the perspective was changed from field to observer at S2. More importantly, this reduction in emotional intensity persisted until S3. These effects were not observed under observer-to-field perspective change at S2.

It is less clear how a break in the continuous interaction between these two representations may be a crucial marker to detect patients who are at risk to develop dementia. The main objective of this study is to compare the performances of participants suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI group), patients with AD (AD group) and a control group (CG), using a virtual reality (VR)-based procedure for assessing the abilities in encoding, storing and syncing different spatial representations. In the first task, participants were required to indicate on a real map the position of the object they had memorized, while in the second task they were invited to retrieve its position from an empty version of the same virtual room, starting from a different position. The entire procedure was repeated across three different trials, depending on the object location in the encoding phase. Our finding showed that aMCI patients performed significantly more poorly in the third trial of the first task, showing a deficit in the ability to encode and store an allocentric viewpoint independent representation. On the other hand, AD patients performed significantly more poorly when compared to the CG in the second task, indicating a specific impairment in storing an allocentric viewpoint independent representation and then syncing it with the allocentric viewpoint dependent representation. Furthermore, data suggested that these impairments are not a product of generalized cognitive decline or of general decay in spatial abilities, but instead may reflect a selective deficit in the spatial organization Overall, these findings provide an initial insight into the cognitive underpinnings of amnestic impairment in aMCI and AD patient exploiting the potentiality of VR.",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,7,,88,10.3389/fnagi.2015.00088

In addition, there exists from the earliest stages of AD a specific impairment in mental frame syncing, which is the ability to synchronize an allocentric viewpoint-independent representation (including object-to-object information) with an egocentric one by computing the bearing of each relevant object in the environment in relation to the stored heading in space (i.e., information about our viewpoint contained in the allocentric viewpoint-dependent representation). The main objective of this development-of-concept trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel VR-based training protocol focused on the enhancement of the mental frame syncing of the different spatial representations in subjects with AD. We recruited 20 individuals with AD who were randomly assigned to either VR-based training or Control Group. Moreover, eight cognitively healthy elderly individuals were recruited to participate in the VR-based training in order to have a different comparison group. Based on a neuropsychological assessment, our results indicated a significant improvement in long-term spatial memory after the VR-based training for patients with AD; this means that transference of improvements from the VR-based training to more general aspects of spatial cognition was observed. Interestingly, there was also a significant effect of VR-based training on executive functioning for cognitively healthy elderly individuals.

S. Serino and G. Riva,2014,What is the role of spatial processing in the decline of episodic memory in Alzheimer's disease? The mental frame syncing hypothesis,"The current theories on episodic memory suggest a crucial role of spatial processing for an effective retrieval. For a successful episodic recall, the long-term allocentric scene has to be translated into an egocentric scene. Here, we argue that a crucial role for an episodic retrieval is played by a mental frame syncing between two kinds of allocentric representations. This neurocognitive process allows an effective retrieval of our past experiences by synchronizing the allocentric view-point independent representation with the allocentric view-point dependent representation. If the mental frame syncing stops, even momentarily, it is difficult to reconstruct a coherent spatial scaffold upon which to effectively retrieve our previous events within an egocentric perspective. This is what apparently happens in Alzheimer's disease: a break in the mental frame syncing between these two kinds of allocentric representations, underpinned by damage to the hippocampus, may contribute significantly to the early deficit in episodic memory.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,6,,33,

However, although a growing body of interesting models have been proposed to explain this early symptom, what is still missing is a unifying framework of all the characteristic signs occurring in patients with AD that may guide the search for its causal neuropathological process and, ultimately, the etiological process. This contribution will first show how anosognosia may be related to the above-mentioned episodic and spatial memory impairment through a unifying framework of all these characteristic signs, i.e., the continuous interaction between different spatial representations. Second, we hypothesize that a break in the interaction between different spatial representations, as we suggest occurs in AD, may contribute significantly both to the early impairments in spatial and episodic memory, and to a deficient self-awareness since it may interfere with the capacity of the brain to detect predictive errors.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,55,3,881-892,
S. Sheldon and A. Ruel,2017,The many routes of mental navigation: contrasting the effects of a detailed and gist retrieval approach on using and forming spatial representations,"Navigated routes can be recalled by remembering a schematic layout or with additional sensory and perceptual details, engaging episodic memory processes. In this study, we contrasted the effects of these remembering approaches on retrieving real-world navigated routes, the impact on flexibly using familiar route information and on learning new spatial representations. In a within-subjects design, participants were oriented to recall familiar routes under two remembering conditions-a detail condition that promoted episodic memory processes and a gist condition in which routes were recalled via schematic processes. In each condition, participants performed two subsequent navigation tasks. They first described solutions to navigation problems that involved the recalled familiar route (e.g., navigating around a road block or to a new destination) and then learned and recalled a route within a novel spatial environment. All navigation descriptions were scored for the number of spatial references, entities, and sensory descriptions. We report the following findings. First, when describing the familiar routes, more details were generated in the detail condition, but a higher proportion of these details were spatial references in the gist condition. Route descriptions in the gist condition also relied more on egocentric spatial representations than in the detail condition. Next, when solving navigation problems in the familiar environment, solution routes were described with more details in the detail condition and deviated less from the familiar route than in the gist condition. Finally, the detail condition led to the preferential encoding of entity and sensory descriptive details of new spatial representations. These findings suggest that activating episodic processes at retrieval has distinct effects on how familiar information can be flexibly used and how new spatial representations are formed.",Psychological research,,,,
S. L. Shipman and R. S. Astur,2008,Factors affecting the hippocampal BOLD response during spatial memory,"The hippocampus has long been implicated in spatial memory, from work in rodents to imaging and brain lesion studies in humans. However, recent evidence has pointed to the recruitment of areas outside the hippocampus proper on spatial memory tasks, including the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus, possibly suggesting a more focused role for the hippocampus proper. In this study, a virtual version of the standard rodent spatial memory assessment, the Morris water task, has been employed during fMRI to investigate the differential involvement of these distinct brain areas. Twenty-eight healthy participants completed a block designed version of the virtual Morris water task (vMWT) which consisted of three conditions: (1) a hippocampal dependent condition during which the participants were forced to use distal room cues in the virtual environment to navigate to a hidden platform; (2) a non-hippocampal dependent condition during which participants were to navigate to a visible platform; (3) a fixation period. Activations of the BOLD signal were evident in the hidden condition as compared to the visible condition in the parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, and fusiform when analyzed using to a blocked analysis. Moreover, this blocked analysis revealed increases in the right hippocampal BOLD signal during fixation. However, when hidden trials were compared to visible trials using a post hoc event-related analysis focused on the beginning of each trial, activations of the right hippocampus are evident. These results support the theory that extra-hippocampal structures contribute to spatial memory behavior and identify a temporally specific involvement of the hippocampus. Furthermore, they substantiate previous results reporting hippocampal BOLD increases during fixation.",Behavioural Brain Research,187,2,433-441,10.1016/j.bbr.2007.10.014

One idea is that the hippocampus is specifically important for allocentric spatial memory, e.g., the hippocampus is especially needed to remember object locations when there is a shift in viewpoint between study and test. We tested this proposal in two experiments. Patients with damage limited to the hippocampus were given memory tests for object locations in a virtual environment. In the first experiment, participants studied locations of a variable number of images (one to five) and tried to remember the image locations from either the same viewpoint as during study (shift of 0 degrees) or a different viewpoint (shift of 55 degrees, 85 degrees, or 140 degrees). In each viewpoint condition (shifts of 0 degrees, 55 degrees, 85 degrees, and 140 degrees), patients performed normally when remembering one or two image locations. Further, performance declined to a similar degree in each viewpoint condition as patients tried to remember increasing numbers of image locations. In the second experiment, participants tried to remember four images after viewpoint shifts of 0 degrees, 55 degrees, 85 degrees, or 140 degrees. Patients were mildly impaired at all conditions (shifts of 0 degrees, 55 degrees, 85 degrees, and 140 degrees), and the impairment was no greater when viewpoint shifted. We conclude that damage to the hippocampus does not selectively impair viewpoint-independent spatial memory. Rather, hippocampal damage impairs memory as the memory load increases.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,104,8,2961-2966,10.1073/pnas.0611233104

"M. C. Silveri, N. Ciccarelli and A.

We hypothesize that as degenerative brain diseases are system pathologies, degeneration could be restricted to some of the neural subsystems implicated in the functional organization of spatial attention and different neglect syndromes could emerge depending on the patterns of the subsystems involved. METHOD: We studied five neglect patients: one with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), three with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) and one with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). RESULTS: The patient with CBD and left parietoccipital atrophy showed right allocentric neglect; the three patients with PCA mostly distributed in the right posterior regions showed left egocentric extrapersonal neglect; the patient with FTD, who displayed more severe frontotemporal atrophy on the right, had left motor-executive neglect for both personal and extrapersonal space. All patients also presented a deep breakdown of spatial working memory. CONCLUSION: Our data would confirm that left neglect is more frequent than right neglect also in degenerative pathology and that damage to different neural substrates can produce different types of neglect. Our findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that both lateralized and nonlateralized attention disorders contribute to generate the syndrome. We suggest that evidence from degenerative diseases may contribute to construction of models of spatial attention.",Neuropsychology,25,5,554-566,10.1037/a0023957

Distance trials assessed the ability to regulate emotion by recalling memories from a third-person, objective viewpoint. Immerse trials assessed emotional reactivity and involved recalling memories from a first-person perspective. Behaviorally, both groups reported less negative affect on Distance as compared to Immerse trials. Neurally, two sets of findings were obtained. The first reflected differences between attempters and non-attempters. When immersing and distancing, attempters showed elevated recruitment of lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region implicated in using negative cues to guide behavior. When distancing, attempters showed diminished recruitment of the precuneus, a region implicated in memory recall and perspective taking. The second set of findings related to individual differences in regulation success - the degree to which individuals used distancing to reduce negative affect. Here, we observed that attempters who successfully regulated exhibited precuneus recruitment that was more similar to non-attempters. These data provide insight into mechanisms underlying suicide attempts in BPD. Future work may examine if these findings generalize to other diagnoses and also whether prior findings in BPD differ across attempters and non-attempters.",Journal of psychiatric research,81,,71-78,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.06.020

Participants in the PTSD group performed significantly worse on allocentric spatial processing than trauma-exposed controls. Groups performed comparably on egocentric memory and non-spatial memory for lists of objects. Exposure to repeated incident trauma was also associated with significantly worse spatial processing in the PTSD group.

He was allowed to explore a large-scale virtual reality town and was then tested on his memory for spatial layout and for episodes experienced. Topographical memory was tested by assessing his ability to navigate, recognize previously visited locations, and draw maps of the town. Episodic memory was assessed by testing the retrieval of simulated events which consisted of collecting objects from characters while following a route through the virtual town. Memory for the identity of objects, as well as for where they were collected, from whom, and in what order, was also tested. While the first task tapped simple recognition memory, the latter three tested memory for context. Jon was impaired on all topographical tasks and on his recall of the context-dependent questions. However, his recognition of objects from the virtual town, and of topographical scenes (as evaluated by standard neuropsychological tests), was not impaired.

"P. L. St Jacques, A. C. Carpenter, K. K. Szpunar and D. L. Schacter",2018,Remembering and imagining alternative versions of the personal past,"Although autobiographical memory and episodic simulations recruit similar core brain regions, episodic simulations engage additional neural recruitment in the frontoparietal control network due to greater demands on constructive processes. However, previous functional neuroimaging studies showing differences in remembering and episodic simulation have focused on veridical retrieval of past experiences, and thus have not fully considered how retrieving the past in different ways from how it was originally experienced may also place similar demands on constructive processes. Here we examined how alternative versions of the past are constructed when adopting different egocentric perspectives during autobiographical memory retrieval compared to simulating hypothetical events from the personal past that could have occurred, or episodic counterfactual thinking. Participants were asked to generate titles for specific autobiographical memories from the last five years, and then, during functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) scanning, were asked to repeatedly retrieve autobiographical memories or imagine counterfactual events cued by the titles. We used an fMRI adaptation paradigm in order to isolate neural regions that were sensitive to adopting alternative egocentric perspectives and counterfactual simulations of the personal past. The fMRI results revealed that voxels within left posterior inferior parietal and ventrolateral frontal cortices were sensitive to novel visual perspectives and counterfactual simulations. Our findings suggest that the neural regions supporting remembering become more similar to those underlying episodic simulation when we adopt alternative egocentric perspectives of the veridical past.",Neuropsychologia,110,,170-179,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.06.015

Cabeza",2011,Watching my mind unfold versus yours: an fMRI study using a novel camera technology to examine neural differences in self-projection of self versus other perspectives,"Self-projection, the capacity to re-experience the personal past and to mentally infer another person's perspective, has been linked to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In particular, ventral mPFC is associated with inferences about one's own self, whereas dorsal mPFC is associated with inferences about another individual. In the present fMRI study, we examined self-projection using a novel camera technology, which employs a sensor and timer to automatically take hundreds of photographs when worn, in order to create dynamic visuospatial cues taken from a first-person perspective. This allowed us to ask participants to self-project into the personal past or into the life of another person. We predicted that self-projection to the personal past would elicit greater activity in ventral mPFC, whereas self-projection of another perspective would rely on dorsal mPFC. There were three main findings supporting this prediction. First, we found that self-projection to the personal past recruited greater ventral mPFC, whereas observing another person's perspective recruited dorsal mPFC. Second, activity in ventral versus dorsal mPFC was sensitive to parametric modulation on each trial by the ability to relive the personal past or to understand another's perspective, respectively. Third, task-related functional connectivity analysis revealed that ventral mPFC contributed to the medial temporal lobe network linked to memory processes, whereas dorsal mPFC contributed to the fronto-parietal network linked to controlled processes. In sum, these results suggest that ventral-dorsal subregions of the anterior midline are functionally dissociable and may differentially contribute to self-projection of self versus other.",J Cogn Neurosci,23,6,1275-1284,
"A. Staniloiu, S. Borsutzky, F. G. Woermann and H. J. Markowitsch",2013,Social cognition in a case of amnesia with neurodevelopmental mechanisms,"Episodic–autobiographical memory (EAM) is considered to emerge gradually in concert with the development of other cognitive abilities (such as executive functions, personal semantic knowledge, emotional knowledge, theory of mind (ToM) functions, language, and working memory). On the brain level its emergence is accompanied by structural and functional reorganization of different components of the so-called EAM network. This network includes the hippocampal formation, which is viewed as being vital for the acquisition of memories of personal events for long-term storage. Developmental studies have emphasized socio-cultural-linguistic mechanisms that may be unique to the development of EAM. Furthermore it was hypothesized that one of the main functions of EAM is the social one. In the research field, the link between EAM and social cognition remains however debated. Herein we aim to bring new insights into the relation between EAM and social information processing (including social cognition) by describing a young adult patient with amnesia with neurodevelopmental mechanisms due to perinatal complications accompanied by hypoxia. The patient was investigated medically, psychiatrically, and with neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Structural high resolution magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant bilateral hippocampal atrophy as well as indices for degeneration in the amygdalae, basal ganglia, and thalamus, when a less conservative threshold was applied. In addition to extensive memory investigations and testing other (non-social) cognitive functions, we employed a broad range of tests that assessed social information processing (social perception, social cognition, social regulation). Our results point to both preserved (empathy, core ToM functions, visual affect selection, and discrimination, affective prosody discrimination) and impaired domains of social information processing (incongruent affective prosody processing, complex social judgments). They support proposals for a role of the hippocampal formation in processing more complex social information that likely requires multimodal relational handling.

We constructed a comprehensive item pool to assess these dimensions and, using data from several large samples ( Ns = 941; 510; 212), we showed that: (a) all 10 scales had adequate reliability (median alpha = .87; range = .72 to .97), (b) the 10-factor structure provided a good fit to the data, and (c) gender, personality, and memory recency had theoretically meaningful relations with the 10 scales. For example, gender and ethnicity differences in phenomenology were mediated by memory content, and early and recent memories had distinct phenomenologies. The discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical utility of the 10 scales.

This paper analyses the distinction in personal memory between such external observer visuospatial perspectives and 'field' perspectives, in which I experience the remembered actions and events as from my original point of view. It argues that Richard Wollheim's related distinction between centred and acentred memory fails to capture the key phenomena, and criticizes Wollheim's reasons for doubting that observer 'memories' are genuine personal memories. Since field perspectives in personal memory are also likely to be the product of constructive processes, we should reject the common assumption that such constructive processes inevitably bring distortion and error. Yet field perspectives tend to be treated as privileged also in the domains of memory for skilled movement, and memory for trauma. In each case, it is argued that visuospatial perspective in personal memory should be distinguished from other kinds of perspective such as kinesthetic perspective and emotional perspective.",Philosophical Studies,148,1,27-37,10.1007/s11098-010-9498-z

Positive affect enhanced recall of peripheral details. Furthermore, the impairment of peripheral recall was greatest in memories of anger, not of fear. Reliving the experience at retrieval was negatively correlated with recall of peripheral details for some emotions (e.g., anger) but not others (e.g., fear), irrespective of similarities in affect and intensity. Within individuals, recall of peripheral details was correlated with less belief in the memory's accuracy and more likelihood to recall the memory from one's own eyes (i.e., a field perspective).",Cognition & Emotion,23,2,380-398,10.1080/02699930801993999

METHOD: A cohort of 22 patients with dementia (11 bvFTD; 11 AD) and 14 healthy controls were assessed on the virtual supermarket task of spatial orientation and a battery of standardized neuropsychological measures of visual and verbal memory performance. RESULTS: Judgements of egocentric and allocentric heading direction were differentially impaired in bvFTD and AD, with AD performing significantly worse on egocentric heading judgements than bvFTD. Both patient cohorts, however, showed similar degree of impaired allocentric spatial representation, and associated hippocampal pathology.

By contrast, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes show generally intact spatial orientation at presentation. However, currently no clinical tasks are routinely administered to objectively assess spatial orientation in these neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we investigated spatial orientation in 58 dementia patients and 23 healthy controls using a novel virtual supermarket task as well as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We compared performance on this task with visual and verbal memory function, which has traditionally been used to discriminate between AD and FTD. Participants viewed a series of videos from a first person perspective travelling through a virtual supermarket and were required to maintain orientation to a starting location. Analyses revealed significantly impaired spatial orientation in AD, compared to FTD patient groups. Spatial orientation performance was found to discriminate AD and FTD patient groups to a very high degree at presentation. More importantly, integrity of the RSC was identified as a key neural correlate of orientation performance. These findings confirm the notion that i) it is feasible to assess spatial orientation objectively via our novel Supermarket task; ii) impaired orientation is a prominent feature that can be applied clinically to discriminate between AD and FTD and iii) the RSC emerges as a critical biomarker to assess spatial orientation deficits in these neurodegenerative conditions.",Cortex,67,,83-94,10.1016/j.cortex.2015.03.016

In three studies, we examined the effect of perspective taken to visualize a future action (first-person vs. third-person) as a function of the degree to which individuals worry about others' evaluation of themselves (face) and whether the visualized behavior is public or private. Across all studies, the effect of visual perspective was present only for participants with a high level of face. In this group, the third-person visualization induced stronger intentions to engage in the behavior when the imagined behavior was public (Study 1), whereas the first-person visualization induced stronger intentions and greater likelihood to engage in that behavior when it was private (Study 2). The influence of the first-person perspective on flossing behavior was eliminated when people with high levels of face were encouraged to consider inter-personal consequences of the action (Study 3). Results are discussed in the light of recent theorizing on the cognitive consequences of taking a third-person versus a first-person perspective in visual imagery. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Three experiments manipulated the visual perspective (own first-person vs. observer's third-person) that participants used to picture regretted actions or inactions from their lives. Imagery perspective influences the degree to which people's understanding of events is determined by features of the event itself (first-person) or by the integration of the event with broader self-knowledge (third-person) (Libby & Eibach, in press-b).

G. Vallar and E. Calzolari,2018,Unilateral spatial neglect after posterior parietal damage,"Unilateral spatial neglect is a disabling neurologic deficit, most frequent and severe after right-hemispheric lesions. In most patients neglect involves the left side of space, contralateral to a right-hemispheric lesion. About 50% of stroke patients exhibit neglect in the acute phase. Patients fail to orient, respond to, and report sensory events occurring in the contralateral sides of space and of the body, to explore these portions of space through movements by action effectors (eye, limbs), and to move the contralateral limbs. Neglect is a multicomponent higher-level disorder of spatial awareness, cognition, and attention. Spatial neglect may occur independently of elementary sensory and motor neurologic deficits, but it can mimic and make them more severe. Diagnostic tests include: motor exploratory target cancellation; setting the midpoint of a horizontal line (bisection), that requires the estimation of lateral extent; drawing by copy and from memory; reading, assessing neglect dyslexia; and exploring the side of the body contralateral to the lesion. Activities of daily living scales are also used. Patients are typically not aware of neglect, although they may exhibit varying degrees of awareness toward different components of the deficit. The neural correlates include lesions to the inferior parietal lobule of the posterior parietal cortex, which was long considered the unique neuropathologic correlate of neglect, to the premotor and to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, to the posterior superior temporal gyrus, at the temporoparietal junction, to subcortical gray nuclei (thalamus, basal ganglia), and to parietofrontal white-matter fiber tracts, such as the superior longitudinal fascicle. Damage to the inferior parietal lobule of the posterior parietal cortex is specifically associated with the mainly egocentric, perceptual, and exploratory extrapersonal, and with the personal, bodily components of neglect.

Because patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often report mood disturbances and past traumatic experiences, it would be plausible to expect that these patients too would retrieve higher proportions of observer memories. Therefore, and given the phenotypical variance of BPD, we examined whether vantage perspective during recall is associated with one or more BPD symptom clusters.METHODSA community sample consisting of 148 volunteers (66 males) completed the Autobiographical Memory Test, the Borderline Syndrome Index, and the Depression Scale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.RESULTSInterpersonal and anxious-neurotic BPD features were associated with higher proportions of observer memories.CONCLUSIONSThe proportion of observer memories was not associated with the total number of BPD symptoms.

S. D. Vann,2009,Guddens ventral tegmental nucleus is vital for memory: re-evaluating diencephalic inputs for amnesia,"Mammillary body atrophy is present in a number of neurological conditions and recent clinical findings highlight the importance of these nuclei for memory. While most accounts of diencephalic amnesia emphasize the functional importance of the hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies, the present study tested the importance of the other major input to the mammillary bodies, the projections from the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTNg). Although the VTNg, and its projections to the mammillary bodies, is present across species, the size and location of this structure has made it an extremely difficult structure to assess in primates. The effects of selective, neurotoxic lesions of the VTNg were, therefore, assessed in rats. The animals with these lesions were impaired on a series of spatial learning tasks, namely delayed-matching-to-place in the water maze, T-maze alternation and working memory in the radial arm maze. Normal performance on these tasks is dependent on those brain structures (e.g. hippocampus and mammillary bodies) that are now assumed to cause anterograde amnesia when damaged in humans. In contrast, the same rats with ventral tegmental nucleus lesions performed normally on two control tasks: the acquisition and subsequent reversal of an egocentric discrimination task and a visually cued task in the water maze. This study provides the first clear evidence that the VTNg is critical for memory, and consequently indicates that diencephalichippocampal models of memory should be extended to incorporate the limbic midbrain.",Brain,132,,2372-2384,10.1093/brain/awp175
S. D. Vann,2011,A role for the head-direction system in geometric learning,"Several recent models of episodic memory have highlighted a potential contribution from the head-direction system; there is, however, surprisingly little known about the behavioural effects of selective lesions within the head-direction system. To address this issue, and determine what aspects of spatial memory are dependent on the head-direction system, rats with selective lateral mammillary body lesions were tested on tasks that required the use of specific spatial cues, including direction, visual allocentric, and geometric cues. Animals were first tested on a modified version of the T-maze alternation task that enabled the systematic removal of intramaze and visual allocentric cues. Rats were next tested on a geometric task that required the use of the shape of the environment to locate a hidden platform in the water-maze. The lesion rats were impaired on one stage of the T-maze alternation task and on the acquisition of the geometric task; these results are consistent with the head-direction system contributing to the processing of, and/or subsequent use, of visual allocentric and geometric cues. From the pattern of impairments it also appears that, with training, rats with lateral mammillary body lesions are able to recruit other navigational systems or that there is some degree of redundancy within the head-direction system.

N. C. Vella and M. L. Moulds,2014,The impact of shifting vantage perspective when recalling and imagining positive events,"The vantage perspective from which memories are recalled influences their emotional impact. To date, however, the impact of vantage perspective on the emotions elicited by positive memories and images of positive future events has been minimally explored. We experimentally manipulated the vantage perspective from which a sample of undergraduate students (n =80) recalled positive memories and imagined positive future events. Participants who naturally recalled their positive memories from a field perspective reported decreased vividness and positive affect (i.e., happiness, optimism, hopefulness) when they were instructed to shift to an observer perspective. The same pattern of emotionality ratings was observed when participants' vantage perspective of imagined future events was manipulated. In contrast, shifting participants from observer to field perspective recall of positive memories did not result in changes in ratings of memory-related emotion, although we found an unexpected trend towards reduced vividness. For positive future events, shifting from an observer to a field perspective resulted in decreased vividness but did not lead to any changes in positive emotion. Our findings confirm that vantage perspective plays a key role in determining the emotional impact of positive memories, and demonstrate that this relationship is also evident for images of future positive events.",Memory,22,3,256-264,10.1080/09658211.2013.778292

Perspective proved to be a reliable individual-differences variable. The majority of narratives trended toward the first-person perspective, with memories more likely to yield first-person perspective than future events. Perspective was predicted by detail (higher level of participant-reported visual detail was more likely to elicit first-person perspective), and temporal distance (events reported as being further away in time were more likely to elicit third-person perspective). Detail, in turn, was explained (among others) by the individual-differences variable of depression/social uncertainty (a factor-derived scale consisting of rumination scales, the inverse of the Sense Of Self Scale, the Social Phobia Scale, and, to a lesser extent, the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale). Generally, predictors for memories and future events overlapped.

Savage",2008,"Impaired, spared, and enhanced ACh efflux across the hippocampus and striatum in diencephalic amnesia is dependent on task demands","Diencephalic amnesia manifests itself through a host of neurological and memory impairments. A commonly employed animal model of diencephalic amnesia, pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD), results in brain lesions and impairments similar in nature and distribution to those observed in humans with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). In the current investigation, 2 separate experiments were conducted in which acetylcholine (ACh) efflux was assessed in the hippocampus and striatum of PTD-treated and pair-fed (PF) control male Sprague-Dawley rats. The goal was to determine under what behavioral conditions and in which brain structures ACh efflux was spared, impaired, or adaptively enhanced. In Experiment 1, rats were assessed on a spontaneous alternation task; in Experiment 2, rats were tested on a T-maze discrimination task that could be learned via a hippocampal- or striatal-based strategy. In Experiment 1, PTD-treated rats were impaired on the spontaneous alternation task and ACh efflux in the hippocampus during testing was significantly reduced, but spared in the striatum. In Experiment 2, PTD- and PF-treated rats did not differ in the number of trials to criterion, but PTD-treated rats demonstrated greater reliance upon egocentric cues to solve the task. Furthermore, ACh efflux in the striatum was greater during maze learning in the PTD-treated animals when compared to the PF animals. These results suggest that there is behavioral and systems level plasticity that can facilitate the use of alternative strategies to solve a task following diencephalic damage and WKS.

At the underlying representational or cognitive level, these operations are processed in an egocentric reference frame, where locations are represented centered around another person's (3PP) or one's own perspective (1PP). To study 3PP and 1PP, both operating in egocentric frames, a virtual scene with an avatar and red balls in a room was presented from different camera viewpoints to normal volunteers (n = 11) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. The task for the subjects was to count the objects as seen either from the avatar's perspective (3PP) or one's own perspective (1PP). The scene was presented either from a ground view (GV) or an aerial view (AV) to investigate the effect of view on perspective taking. The factors perspective (3PP vs. 1PP) and view (GV vs. AV) were arranged in a two-five two-factorial way. Reaction times were increased and percent factorial correctness scores were decreased in 3PP as opposed to 1PP. To detect the neural mechanisms associated with perspective taking, functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed. Data were analyzed using SPM'99 in each subject and non-parametric statistics on the group level. Activations common to 3PP and 1PP (relative to baseline) were observed in a network of occipital, parietal, and prefrontal areas. Deactivations common to 3PP and 1PP (relative to baseline) were observed predominantly in mesial (i.e., parasagittal) cortical and lateral superior temporal areas bilaterally. Differential increases of neural activity were found in mesial superior parietal and right premotor cortex during 3PP (relative to 1PP), whereas differential increases during 1PP (relative to 3PP) were found in mesial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal cortex bilaterally. The data suggest that in addition to joint neural mechanisms, for example, due to visuospatial processing and decision making, 3PP and 1PP rely on differential neural processes. Mesial cortical areas are involved in decisional processes when the spatial task is solved from one's own viewpoint, whereas egocentric operations from another person's perspective differentially draw upon cortical areas known to be involved in spatial cognition.",Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,16,5,817-827,Doi 10.1162/089892904970799

The ability to do this depends on learning and remembering locations. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues and nearby proximal cues, egocentric navigation. Allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures; in humans this system encodes allocentric, semantic, and episodic memory. This form of memory is assessed in laboratory animals in many ways, but the dominant form of assessment is the Morris water maze (MWM). Egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and, when overlearned, becomes procedural memory. In this article, several allocentric assessment methods for rodents are reviewed and compared with the MWM. MWM advantages (little training required, no food deprivation, ease of testing, rapid and reliable learning, insensitivity to differences in body weight and appetite, absence of nonperformers, control methods for proximal cue learning, and performance effects) and disadvantages (concern about stress, perhaps not as sensitive for working memory) are discussed. Evidence-based design improvements and testing methods are reviewed for both rats and mice. Experimental factors that apply generally to spatial navigation and to MWM specifically are considered.

Subjects indicated the relative positions of a person or object (referenced by the personal pronouns he/she/it) in a previously shown image relative to either themselves (egocentric reference frame) or shifted to a reference frame anchored in another person or object in the image (allocentric reference frame), e.g. Was he in front of you/her? Good performers had both shorter response time and more correct responses than poor performers in both tasks. These behavioural variables were entered into a principal component analysis. The first component reflected generalised performance level. We found that the frontal eye fields (FEF), bilaterally, had a higher BOLD response during recall involving allocentric compared to egocentric spatial reference frames, and that this difference was larger in good performers than in poor performers as measured by the first behavioural principal component. The frontal eye fields may be used when subjects move their internal gaze during shifting reference frames in representational space. Analysis of actual eye movements in three subjects revealed no difference between egocentric and allocentric recall tasks where visual stimuli were also absent. Thus, the FEF machinery for directing eye movements may also be involved in changing reference frames within WM.",Neuropsychologia,46,2,399-408,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.08.014

Recent research has suggested that ACEs arising during spatial memory retrieval are additionally modulated by individual differences in how experienced participants are with a college campus environment. However, the extent and nature of experience with a real-world environment is difficult to assess and control, and characteristics of the retrieval task itself might modulate ACEs during spatial memory retrieval. The present study provides a more controlled and in-depth examination of how individual differences and task-based factors interact to shape ACEs when participants retrieve spatial memories. In two experiments, participants with varied video game experience learned a virtual environment and then used the computer mouse to verify spatial relationships from different perspectives. Mouse trajectories demonstrated ACEs, differing by retrieval perspective and video game experience. Videogame experts demonstrated the ACE based on learned spatial relationships during egocentric retrieval only, whereas videogame novices showed the ACE based on semantic processing of directional terms only. Specifically, gaming experts invoke perspective-specific perceptuo-motor associations to retrieve spatial knowledge, whereas non-experts are influenced by semantically based associations specific to the retrieval task. Results are discussed in the context of action-compatibility effects, the intentional weighting hypothesis, and the flexible encoding and retrieval of spatial information.",Psychol Res,,,,

The results indicate that TLE subjects with right-sided posterior PHG lesions were impaired on virtual maze acquisition when compared with controls and TLE subjects with anterior PHG lesions. Larger posterior PHG lesions were significantly related to stronger impairments in virtual maze performance.

"G. Weniger, M. Ruhleder, S. Wolf, C. Lange and E.

Virtual reality environments have a major advantage for the assessment of spatial navigation and memory formation, as computer-simulated first-person environments can simulate navigation in a large-scale space. However, virtual reality studies on allocentric memory in subjects with cortical lesions are rare, and studies on egocentric memory are lacking. Twenty-four subjects with unilateral parietal cortex lesions due to infarction or intracerebral haemorrhage (14 left-sided, 10 right-sided) were compared with 36 healthy matched control subjects on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Subjects further received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological investigation, and MRI lesion assessment using T(1), T(2) and FLAIR sequences as well as 3D MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. Results indicate that left- and right-sided lesioned subjects did not differ on task performance. Compared with control subjects, subjects with parietal cortex lesions were strongly impaired learning the virtual maze. On the other hand, performance of subjects with parietal cortex lesions on the virtual park was entirely normal. Volumes of the right-sided precuneus of lesioned subjects were significantly related to performance on the virtual maze, indicating better performance of subjects with larger volumes. It is concluded that parietal cortices support egocentric navigation and imagination during spatial learning in large-scale environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the putative role of the PHC in egocentric (body-centered) spatial learning has received only limited systematic investigation. METHODS: To examine the role of the PHC in egocentric learning, 19 healthy volunteers learned to find their way in a virtual maze during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The virtual maze presented a first-person view, lacked any topographical landmarks and could be learned only using egocentric navigation strategies. RESULTS: During learning, increased medial temporal lobe activity was observed in the PHC bilaterally. Activity was also observed in cortical areas known to project to the PHC and proposed to contribute to egocentric spatial navigation and memory. CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to a role of the PHC for the representation and storage of egocentric information. It seems possible that the PHC contributes to egocentric memory by its feedback projections to the posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, access to allocentric and egocentric streams of spatial information may enable the PHC to construct a global and comprehensive representation of spatial environments and to promote the construction of stable cognitive maps by translating between egocentric and allocentric frames of memory.",Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,93,1,46-55,10.1016/j.nlm.2009.08.003

Specifically, the current study sought to ascertain whether shifting participants into a converse perspective would have differential effects on the reported experience of their memory. Results indicated that shifting participants from a field to an observer perspective resulted in decreased experiential ratings: specifically, reduced distress and vividness. Also, as anticipated, the converse shift in perspective (from observer to field) did not lead to a corresponding increase in experiential ratings, but did result in reduced ratings of observation and a trend was observed for decreased levels of detachment. The findings support the notion that recall perspective has a functional role in the regulation of intrusion-related distress and represents a cognitive avoidance mechanism.

Probe tests indicated that the VR-O rats retained allocentric spatial memory for the environment and were not using sensory or other non-spatial cues to guide behaviour. Overall, the results indicate that the aged rats experienced a decline in the ability to learn and remember detailed spatial relationships and that the VR-O group's successful performance on the remote spatial memory test was guided by a form of schematic memory that captured the essential features of the village environment.

T. Wolbers and C. Buchel,2005,Dissociable retrosplenial and hippocampal contributions to successful formation of survey representations,"During everyday navigation, humans encounter complex environments predominantly from a first-person perspective. Behavioral evidence suggests that these perceptual experiences can be used not only to acquire route knowledge but also to directly assemble map-like survey representations. Most studies of human navigation focus on the retrieval of previously learned environments, and the neural foundations of integrating sequential views into a coherent representation are not yet fully understood. We therefore used our recently introduced virtual-reality paradigm, which provides accuracy and reaction-time measurements precisely indicating the emergence of survey knowledge, and functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants repeatedly encoded a complex environment from a first-person ground-level perspective. Before the experiment, we gave specific instructions to induce survey learning, which, based on the clear evidence for emerging survey knowledge in the behavioral data from 11 participants, proved successful. Neuroimaging data revealed increasing activation across sessions only in bilateral retrosplenial cortices, thus paralleling behavioral measures of map expertise. In contrast, hippocampal activation did not follow absolute performance but rather reflected the amount of knowledge acquired in a given session. In other words, hippocampal activation was most prominent during the initial learning phase and decayed after performance had approached ceiling level. We therefore conclude that, during navigational learning, retrosplenial areas mainly serve to integrate egocentric spatial information with cues about self-motion, whereas the hippocampus is needed to incorporate new information into an emerging memory representation.",Journal of Neuroscience,25,13,3333-3340,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4705-04.2005

This study examined whether postoperative enrichment promotes the recovery of the flexible use of spatial representations in rats with AT lesions. After training to swim from a single constant start position to a submerged platform in a Morris water maze, rats with AT lesions that were housed in standard cages (AT-Std) performed poorly when required to swim to the platform from novel start positions during probe trials. By contrast, rats with AT lesions but housed in enriched environments (AT-Enr), like sham-lesion rats, showed relatively little disruption when tested with novel start positions. AT-Std rats also initially showed impaired acquisition of the task, whereas AT-Enr rats learned at a similar rate to that of the Sham-Std group. Beneficial effects of enrichment were replicated in the subsequent standard water maze procedure that used varying start positions throughout training to acquire a new platform location. Although it is clear that AT damage can severely disrupt episodic-like memory processes, and appear to be a core part of the interlinked neural systems subserving episodic memory, the current findings strongly encourage study on the adaptive response of the brain to thalamic lesions and prospects for the development of rehabilitation programs in cases of anterograde amnesia associated with diencephalic injury.

The scenes displayed objects at certain locations for participants to form unconscious object-in-space memories. Later, the same scenes were presented supraliminally, that is, visibly, for retrieval testing. Scenes were presented absent the objects and rotated by 90°-270° in perspective to assess the representational flexibility of unconsciously formed memories. During the test phase, participants performed a forced-choice task that required them to place an object in one of two highlighted scene locations and their eye movements were recorded. Evaluation of the eye tracking data revealed that participants remembered object locations unconsciously, irrespective of changes in viewing perspective. This effect of gaze was related to correct placements of objects in scenes, and an intuitive decision style was necessary for unconscious memories to influence intentional behavior to a significant degree. We conclude that conscious perception is not mandatory for spatial episodic memory formation.",Hippocampus,,,,10.1002/hipo.22957
"J. A. Xu, H. R. Evensmoen, H. Lehn, C. W. S. Pintzka and A. K. Haberg",2010,Persistent posterior and transient anterior medial temporal lobe activity during navigation,"A functional segregation along the posterior-anterior axis of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been suggested. In brief, it is thought that the posterior hippocampus represents environmental detail and/or encodes space, whereas the anterior part represents the environment more as a whole and/or subserves behavior. Different phases of navigation should thus recruit different structures within the MTL. Based on animal studies and neuroimaging data from humans, the initial phase of navigation, i.e., self-localization, target localization and path planning, should depend on the anterior MTL independent of upcoming navigational demands, whereas posterior MTL should be active throughout navigation. We tested this prediction using fMRI with navigation in a learned large-scale virtual office landscape with numerous complex landmarks under different navigational conditions. The initial navigational phase specifically engaged the anterior MTL. Increased activity was found bilaterally in the rostral and caudal entorhinal cortex. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of entorhinal activity in virtual navigation detected in a direct comparison. Also bilateral anterior hippocampus and anterior parahippocampal cortex were significantly more active during the initial phase. Activity lasting throughout the navigational period was found in the right posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. Hippocampal activity for the entire navigation period was only detected when the virtual environment remained unaltered. Navigational success was positively correlated with activity in the anterior right hippocampus for the initial phase, and more posteriorly in the hippocampus for the whole navigation period. Plots of the BOLD signal time course demonstrated that activity in the anterior hippocampus was transient whereas activity in the posterior hippocampus peaked regularly throughout the entire navigation period. These results support a functional segregation within the MTL with regard to navigational phases. The anterior MTL appears to complete associations related to the environment at large and provide a behavioral plan for navigation, whereas the posterior part keeps track of current location.",Neuroimage,52,4,1654-1666,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.05.074
"C. Yasinski, A. M. Hayes and J. P. Laurenceau",2016,"Rumination in Everyday Life: The Influence of Distancing, Immersion, and Distraction","Rumination has been consistently associated with the development and maintenance of a variety of psychological disorders. While recent research has investigated a number of strategies to counter rumination and its negative effects, few have investigated their efficacy outside of a clinical or laboratory context. The current study used a daily diary methodology to compare the efficacy of three such strategies in the everyday lives of a highly ruminative sample. Over the course of 10 days, participants (N = 154) were asked to apply one of three perspectives (distanced, immersed, or distraction) to their thoughts and emotions about the most stressful event of the day and then to write a short narrative about the event. Over the 10-day period, immersion was associated with an average increase in negative emotion from before to after the narrative, whereas distancing was associated with little reactivity, and distraction was associated with a decrease in negative emotion. Participants in the distanced condition showed less ruminative, unproductive processing and used fewer negative emotion words in the narratives than those in the immersed condition. These differences were maintained over the 10-day study period. In targeted analyses of the days with the highest level of ruminative processing and/or event-related stress for each individual, the distanced and immersed groups reported similar levels of negative emotion reactivity and word use, but the distanced group showed less ruminative processing in the narratives. An interaction emerged suggesting that ruminative processing was only associated with an increase in negative emotion in the immersed group and not in the distanced group. The findings are discussed in the context of decreasing risk for depression and related disorders by targeting emotion regulation strategies on a daily level. (C) Copyright 2016 Textrum Ltd.

T. Zalla and F. De Vignemont,2000,Conscience et monitoring de la source. Apport de la neuropsychologie et de la psychopathologie,"In this article we defend the hypothesis that the phenomenal properties of conscious experience play a functional role in cognition. Specifically, we propose that their function is to inform the cognitive systems involved in decision-making and action monitoring about the nature and origin of the information being processed. Many studies in experimental psychology, in neuropsychology and in psychopathology bear on impairments of a specific type of memory, distinct from semantic or episodic memory, that we call source memory. The term source refers to a type of qualitative attributes and dimensions which specify the conditions under which the knowledge has been acquired, namely the perceptive details and contextual information of the representations. These properties which are perceived in a first person perspective allow to discriminate between memories and general internal knowledge, between imagined events and perceived events, and more generally between self-generated representations and perceptions of external states which have the same representational content. Overall, these studies show that the identification of the source of information plays an important role in a large number of cognitive tasks. They also go against the hypothesis that consciousness is merely an epiphenomenon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",Intellectica,31,,170-190,
H. Zhang and A. Ekstrom,2013,Human neural systems underlying rigid and flexible forms of allocentric spatial representation,"Previous studies suggest the importance of medial temporal lobe, areas of parietal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex in human spatial navigation, though the exact role of these structures in representing the relations of elements within a spatial layout (allocentric representation) remains unresolved. Hippocampal involvement, in particular, during memory processing is affected by whether a previously formed representation is employed in a novel fashion (flexible usage) or in a manner comparable with how it was encoded originally (rigid usage). To address whether brain systems are differentially involved during flexible vs. rigid utilization of a pre-existing allocentric representation, subjects encoded the position of six different target buildings relative to a centrally located landmark building in a virtual city seen from an aerial view. They then actively searched for the locations of these target buildings using the landmark (rigid retrieval) or using a previously shown target building in a novel fashion (flexible retrieval) while undergoing fMRI. Activations in posterior superior parietal cortex and precuneus were greater during more rigid than flexible forms of allocentric retrieval while activation in the hippocampus decreased linearly over blocks during flexible allocentric retrieval. A functional connectivity analysis further revealed significant interactions between hippocampus and these parietal areas during flexible compared with rigid allocentric retrieval. These results extend previous models of the neural basis of spatial navigation by suggesting that while the posterior superior parietal cortex/precuneus play an important role in allocentric representation, the hippocampus, and interactions between hippocampus and these parietal areas, are important for flexible utilization of these representations.",Human Brain Mapping,34,5,1070-1087,10.1002/hbm.21494
J. Zhang and X. J. Yang,2015,Stylistic properties and regulatory fit: Examining the role of self-regulatory focus in the effectiveness of an actor's vs. observer's visual perspective,"Building on regulatory focus research, we investigate how certain visual elements of an advertising message, such as stylistic properties, contribute to regulatory fit and persuasion. Across three experiments, we examine how the visual perspective (actor's vs. observer's) through which a product is depicted in an ad affects product evaluations among participants with different regulatory foci (promotion- vs. prevention-focused). Specifically, we find that when an actor's perspective is used in an ad to portray a product, regulatory fit occurs among promotion-focused (vs. prevention-focused) participants and they report more favorable product evaluations; conversely, when an observer's perspective is used, regulatory fit occurs among prevention-focused (vs. promotion-focused) participants and they evaluate the product more favorably. An analysis of internal vs. external evaluation thoughts helps explain the persuasion effects. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Ren",2013,Perspective taking modulates positivity bias in self-appraisals: Behavioral and event-related potential evidence,"Previous studies have reported that when people self-reflect--they typically judge the self as more positive (or less negative) compared to others on a range of dimensions (such as health, social skills, or achievement). In the present study, we investigated whether viewing the self through the eyes of other people reduces this egocentric (self-centered) bias. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were examined in 17 subjects who performed judgments of adjectives in positive or negative valences from either self-perspective or other-perspective. Reaction times revealed an interaction between the factors perspective and emotional valence. Faster responses occurred after positive words in the self-perspective condition. A similar interaction was observed in the ERP waveforms in the time range of the N400 component: smaller N400 amplitudes were elicited by positive stimuli compared to negative stimuli in the self-perspective condition, but not in the other-perspective condition. Similarly, a reversed pattern was found in the late positive component (LPC) at 415-815 ms. The present study suggests that shifts in perspectives between self and others can change self-appraisal, which in turn reduces egocentric biases of the self. On a neural level, this modulation may be associated with an increase in self-monitoring processes.",Social Neuroscience,8,4,326-333,10.1080/17470919.2013.807873
K. Zimmermann and A. Eschen,2017,Brain regions involved in subprocesses of small-space episodic object-location memory: a systematic review of lesion and functional neuroimaging studies,"Object-location memory (OLM) enables us to keep track of the locations of objects in our environment. The neurocognitive model of OLM (Postma, A., Kessels, R. P. C., & Van Asselen, M. (2004). The neuropsychology of object-location memory.

Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews, 32, 1339-1345. doi: 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.05.001 ) proposes that distinct brain regions are specialised for different subprocesses of OLM (object processing, location processing, and object-location binding; categorical and coordinate OLM; egocentric and allocentric OLM). It was based mainly on findings from lesion studies. However, recent episodic memory studies point to a contribution of additional or different brain regions to object and location processing within episodic OLM. To evaluate and update the neurocognitive model of OLM, we therefore conducted a systematic literature search for lesion as well as functional neuroimaging studies contrasting small-space episodic OLM with object memory or location memory. We identified 10 relevant lesion studies and 8 relevant functional neuroimaging studies. We could confirm some of the proposals of the neurocognitive model of OLM, but also differing hypotheses from episodic memory research, about which brain regions are involved in the different subprocesses of small-space episodic OLM. In addition, we were able to identify new brain regions as well as important research gaps.","Memory (Hove, England)",25,4,487-519,10.1080/09658211.2016.1188965
