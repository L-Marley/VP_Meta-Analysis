In some memories, one has the perspective of an observer, seeing oneself ""from the outside."" In other memories, one sees the scene from one's own perspective; the field of view in such memories corresponds to that of the original situation. The existence of ""observer"" and ""field"" memories was confirmed in Study 1, using a recall questionnaire. In Study 2, the similarity structure of a specified set of 8 to-be-recalled situations was established: The significant dimensions were emotionality and self-awareness. Study 3 related these dimensions to the observerâ€“field distinction; situations involving a high degree of emotion and self-awareness were most likely to be recalled with an observer perspective. Recall set was varied in Study 4: A focus on feelings, as opposed to objective circumstances, produced relatively more field memories. Studies 3 and 4 also showed that events reported as more recent tended to be recalled in the field mode. Thus, a qualitative characteristic of personal memoriesâ€”the perspective from which they are experiencedâ€”is apparently related to characteristics of the original event, to the individual's purpose in recalling that event, and to the reported recall interval.

In this dissertation, two competing explanations for this finding were evaluated. The first possible explanation was that large objects facilitate an observer perspective of the imaged self which, in turn, enhances memory. The second possibility was that large objects encourage the generation of self-images based on autobiographical episodes and that this involvement of episodic knowledge enhances memory.    In three experiments, subjects formed images of either themselves or another person interacting with concrete objects which they subsequently tried to recall. In Experiment 1, instructions to adopt an observer perspective towards the imaged self produced no higher recall than internal perspective instructions. Also, the interaction of referent and object size was still observed with both perspectives.    In Experiments 2 and 3, basing all self-images on autobiographical episodes greatly enhanced recall of self-images, erased the memory difference between large and small objects, and resulted in a large advantage of self- over other-reference. For subjects who generated both episodic and nonepisodic self-images, large objects were better recalled than small objects because episodic images were more common with large than with small objects.    In conclusion, the involvement of episodic knowledge, but not an observer perspective of the self, enhances memory and accounts for the previously observed interaction of referent and object size. Episodic images are probably more memorable than images constructed from semantic knowledge because they allow for more elaborative encoding. The elaborations are due to episodic memories being highly perceptual, extended in time, specified by spatial and temporal context, and richly associated with many other events in memory.    These results clarify the conflict in the literature regarding imagery and self-reference effects. Additionally, they bring the explanation of self-reference effects for imagery encodings in line with that for nonimagery encodings, that is, episodic images allow for more elaborative encodings than nonepisodic images.","1985","2018-06-18 10:49:57","2018-06-18 12:29:23",NA,"",124,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"University of Denver","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","303393117",NA,NA,"8517560",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=The+self-reference+effect+with+imagery+encoding%3A+How+are+visual+perspective+and+episodic+memory+involved%3F&issn=&date=1985-12-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Brown%2C+Polly&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/1986-53011-001&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=THE+SELF-REFERENCE+EFFECT+WITH+IMAGERY+ENCODING%3A++HOW+ARE+VISUAL+PERSPECTIVE+AND+EPISODIC+MEMORY+INVOLVED%3F&issn=&date=1985-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=BROWN%2C+POLLY&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=The+self-reference+effect+with+imagery+encoding%3A+How+are+visual+perspective+and+episodic+memory+involved%3F&issn=&date=1985-12-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Brown%2C+Polly&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/1986-53011-001&rft_id=info:doi/","Human Information Storage; Human; Imagery; Memory; Psychology; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Empirical Study; 0623:Experiments; 0623:Psychology; Experiments; 2343:Learning & Memory; involvement of episodic knowledge & observer perspective of self in imagery encoding, memory, adults",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two major questions were explored: What characteristics make a teacher memorable? Are favorite and least favorite teachers remembered in comparable detail?    Eighty adults, 40 women and 40 men, participated. The respondents had all attended American public schools from 1st through 12th grade and all graduated from high school between 1955 and 1975 (M = 1968).    A two-phase questionnaire was used for data collection. In Phase 1, the respondents selected their favorite and least favorite teachers from 1st to 12th grade and recounted from free-recall their memories about these teachers. In Phase 2, the respondents answered specific questions about these memories, providing short answers to some and rating others on ordered scales. Demographic characteristics about both the respondents and their remembered teachers were elicited in Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively.    The findings demonstrated that even after many years the respondents easily recalled memories of both favorite and least favorite teachers. The recollections of favorite and least favorite teachers were similar structurally, with individual memories linked by associations. For both favorite and least favorite teachers, varied themes, including teaching style and personality, persisted in memory. Visual and non-visual sensory images were also frequently recalled.    There were also some distinct differences between the memories of favorite and least favorite teachers. Least favorite teachers were typically recalled from an egocentric perspective; favorite teachers were remembered from a more global focus. In addition, recollections of least favorite teachers stemmed from one specific incident more often than memories of favorite teachers. Negative memorable statements were more frequently recalled than positive ones, but the respondents reported that their overall memories of favorite teachers were clearer than those of least favorite teachers. They also credited their favorite teachers with having had more long-lasting influence on them than their least favorite teachers.    Gender comparisons demonstrated that the memories of women and men were strikingly similar.","1986","2018-06-18 10:49:58","2018-06-18 12:38:58",NA,"",111,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Harvard University","Ann Arbor","English","","Educat.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","303470935",NA,NA,"8704574",NA,"; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=AN+ANALYSIS+OF+EVERYDAY+MEMORIES%3A++RECOLLECTIONS+OF+TEACHERS&issn=&date=1986-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=KRENSKY%2C+LYNNE&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=AN+ANALYSIS+OF+EVERYDAY+MEMORIES%3A++RECOLLECTIONS+OF+TEACHERS&issn=&date=1986-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=KRENSKY%2C+LYNNE&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","0525:Educational psychology; Education; Educational psychology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Additionally, the degree to which a relationship exists between the two categories was studied. Generic personal memories refer to recurring events in an individual's life. Observer point of view refers to the perspective of ""seeing"" oneself in the memory image. Two studies were conducted. Study 1 was designed to replicate prior research on the generic pleasantness phenomenon and to determine if this phenomenon also is found when subjects imagine memories. As predicted, subjects rated generic event memories as significantly more pleasant than single event memories whether the memories were their own or merely imagined. Study 2 sought to examine a proposed relationship between generic personal memories and the observer point of view. Study 2 also examined various aspects of autobiographical memories such as pleasantness, vividness, emotionality, self-awareness, and intensity when memories were categorized as generic versus single event memory and observer versus field memories. Of the numerous findings, the most striking is the similarity between the relationships of generic/observer memories and single event/field memories. Generic and observer memories were rated as more pleasant than single event or field memories whereas single event and field memories were rated as more intense and emotional than generic or observer memories. It appears that the richness of single event personal memories and the field perspective is somewhat lessened in the generic and observer categories. The results seem to fit nicely into notions that distancing from experience (observer rather than field point of view) and remembering events which may represent a self-schema (generic rather than single event) reduces the intensity and/or negativeness of affect due to either the ability to observe the self or the ""complete"" expected behavioral events without ""interruption"".","1990","2018-06-18 10:50:00","2018-06-18 12:26:04",NA,"",178,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"California School of Professional Psychology - Fresno","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","303879096",NA,NA,"9109966",NA,"; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Reconstructive+processes+in+autobiographical+memory%3A+The+generic+pleasantness+phenomenon+and+its+relationship+to+point+of+view&issn=&date=1990-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Amerine%2C+Lueda+Reed&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Reconstructive+processes+in+autobiographical+memory%3A+The+generic+pleasantness+phenomenon+and+its+relationship+to+point+of+view&issn=&date=1990-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Amerine%2C+Lueda+Reed&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","memory; Psychology; 0623:Experiments; 0623:Psychology; Experiments",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we describe a positron emission tomography (PET) study designed to investigate the regional cerebral blood flow changes associated with topographical memory formation in humans, i.e. the formation of representations of large-scale environments necessary for way-finding. Topographical learning of an urban environment from viewing of film footage depicting navigation was associated with activation of the right parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, with activation also of the left parahippocampal gyrus. In addition, there was activity in the pretuneus. In contrast, the encoding of non-navigation episodic memory in a similar realworld context was not associated with activity in the hippocampal formation. Our results shed light on the neural basis of the human representation of large-scale space pinpointing a particular role for the human hippocampal formation in learning to find one's way.","1996-12-22","2018-06-18 10:50:05","2018-06-19 10:14:29",NA,"1745-1750",NA,"1377","263",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","78678775; 9025317",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Learning+to+find+your+way%3A+a+role+for+the+human+hippocampal+formation.&title=Proceedings.+Biological+sciences&issn=09628452&date=1996-12-22&volume=263&issue=1377&spage=1745&au=Maguire%2C+E+A%3BFrackowiak%2C+R+S%3BFrith%2C+C+D&isbn=&jtitle=Proceedings.+Biological+sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/9025317&rft_id=info:doi/; http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/263/1377/1745.full.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/78678775?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Learning+to+find+your+way%3A+a+role+for+the+human+hippocampal+formation.&title=Proceedings.+Biological+sciences&issn=09628452&date=1996-12-22&volume=263&issue=1377&spage=1745&au=Maguire%2C+E+A%3BFrackowiak%2C+R+S%3BFrith%2C+C+D&isbn=&jtitle=Proceedings.+Biological+sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/9025317&rft_id=info:doi/","Adult; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Hippocampus -- anatomy & histology; Hippocampus -- blood supply; Hippocampus -- physiology; Hippocampus/anatomy & histology/blood supply/*physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Learning -- physiology; Learning/*physiology; Male; Memory -- physiology; Memory/physiology; Spatial Behavior -- physiology; Spatial Behavior/physiology; Tomography, Emission-Computed",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Series B, Biological sciences","","0962-8436, 0962-8436","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/79425482?accountid=14182","Allocentric spatial learning can sometimes occur in one trial. The incorporation of information into a spatial representation may, therefore, obey a one-trial correlational learning rule rather than a multi-trial error-correcting rule. It has been suggested that physiological implementation of such a rule could be mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, as its induction obeys a correlational type of synaptic learning rule. Support for this idea came originally from the finding that intracerebral infusion of the NMDA antagonist AP5 impairs spatial learning, but studies summarized in the first part of this paper have called it into question. First, rats previously given experience of spatial learning in a watermaze can learn a new spatial reference memory task at a normal rate despite an appreciable NMDA receptor blockade. Second, the classical phenomenon of 'blocking' occurs in spatial learning. The latter finding implies that spatial learning can also be sensitive to an animal's expectations about reward and so depend on more than the detection of simple spatial correlations. In this paper a new hypothesis is proposed about the function of hippocampal LTP. This hypothesis retains the idea that LTP subserves rapid one-trial memory, but abandons the notion that it serves any specific role in the geometric aspects of spatial learning. It is suggested that LTP participates in the automatic recording of attended experience': a subsystem of episodic memory in which events are temporarily remembered in association with the contexts in which they occur. An automatic correlational form of synaptic plasticity is ideally suited to the online registration of context event associations. In support, it is reported that the ability of rats to remember the most recent place they have visited in a familiar environment is exquisitely sensitive to AP5 in a delay-dependent manner. Moreover, new studies of the lasting persistence of NMDA-dependent LTP, known to require protein synthesis, point to intracellular mechanisms that enable transient synaptic changes to be stabilized if they occur in close temporal proximity to important events. This new property of hippocampal LTP is a desirable characteristic of an event memory system.","1997-10-29","2018-06-18 10:50:06","2018-06-19 10:15:21",NA,"1489-1503",NA,"1360","352",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","79425482; 9368938",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Hippocampal+synaptic+plasticity%3A+role+in+spatial+learning+or+the+automatic+recording+of+attended+experience%3F&title=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&issn=09628436&date=1997-10-29&volume=352&issue=1360&spage=1489&au=Morris%2C+R+G%3BFrey%2C+U&isbn=&jtitle=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/9368938&rft_id=info:doi/; http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/352/1360/1489.full.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/79425482?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Hippocampal+synaptic+plasticity%3A+role+in+spatial+learning+or+the+automatic+recording+of+attended+experience%3F&title=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&issn=09628436&date=1997-10-29&volume=352&issue=1360&spage=1489&au=Morris%2C+R+G%3BFrey%2C+U&isbn=&jtitle=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/9368938&rft_id=info:doi/","0; 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate; 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate -- pharmacology; 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate/pharmacology; 76726-92-6; Animals; Hippocampus -- physiology; Hippocampus/*physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Learning -- physiology; Learning/*physiology; Memory -- physiology; Memory/physiology; Neuronal Plasticity -- physiology; Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology; Rats; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate -- antagonists & inhibitors; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate -- physiology; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology; Spatial Behavior -- physiology; Spatial Behavior/*physiology; Synapses -- physiology; Synapses/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Study I used the imagination inflation methodology reported by Garry et al (1996). No differences were found between narrative reports of inflated and not-inflated events on two measures of elaborateness, supporting the direct decision bias hypothesis of false memory creation. Study 2 used a variation of the interview method originally reported by Loftus & Ketcham (1994) to compare several aspects of recollective experience between true and false remembered events. True memories were rated by participants as better remembered, more important, more emotionally intense, as having clearer imagery, and as less typical than were false memories. Once rehearsal effects were accounted for, only a difference in typicality remained. Imagery in true memories was most often viewed from the field perspective, whereas imagery in false memories was most often viewed from the observer perspective. Similarity between true and false autobiographical memories indicates either the universality of constructive influences on memory or the lack of distinguishability of imagination and memory. Imagery perspective may represent a distinguishing character of memories created through imagination. Greater typicality ratings for false memories also support the direct decision bias hypothesis.","1999","2018-06-18 10:50:07","2018-06-18 12:37:10",NA,"",72,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"The University of Tennessee","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","304527955",NA,NA,"9944259",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Remembering+what+never+happened%3A++Recollective+experience+in+false+autobiographical+memories&issn=&date=1999-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Heaps%2C+Christopher+Michael&isbn=9780599460171&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Remembering+what+never+happened%3A+Recollective+experience+in+false+autobiographical+memories&issn=&date=2000-03-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Heaps%2C+Christopher+Michael&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2000-95006-428&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/619567318?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Remembering+what+never+happened%3A++Recollective+experience+in+false+autobiographical+memories&issn=&date=1999-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Heaps%2C+Christopher+Michael&isbn=9780599460171&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Remembering+what+never+happened%3A+Recollective+experience+in+false+autobiographical+memories&issn=&date=2000-03-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Heaps%2C+Christopher+Michael&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2000-95006-428&rft_id=info:doi/","Imagination; Human; Recollective experience; Memory; Psychology; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; 2340:Cognitive Processes; 0633:Cognitive therapy; Autobiographical memories; Cognitive therapy; False memory; Remembering; False Memory; recollective experience in false childhood autobiographical memories, human Ss",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Past research has shown that depressed individuals have difficulty with memory specificity, and tend to produce overgeneral autobiographical memories. The experiment consisted of 32 depressed and 32 non-depressed students. Subjects were asked to provide specific memories to positive, negative and neutral cue words, and to identify their memories from the observer or field perspective. In the second part of the experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to use the field or observer perspective to recall additional memories. The hypothesis that depressed individuals would be more overgeneral in their recall of autobiographical memories than non-depressed subjects was supported. The hypothesis that depressed individuals would show a greater degree of overgenerality in response to positively-toned cue words compared to negative and neutral cues, and that non-depressed individuals would be more specific in response to positive cue was not supported. The main effect for cue words on memory specificity was significant; depressed and non-depressed subjects were more specific in response to negative cues compared to positive and neutral cue words. It was hypothesized that depressed subjects would be more likely to describe their memories from the field perspective and that non-depressed subjects would be more likely to recall their memories from the observer perspective. This hypothesis was not supported; depressed and non-depressed subjects were not significantly different in their use of the field and observer perspective. The final hypothesis proposed an interaction between memory perspective and memory specificity. it was hypothesized that depressed subjects would provide more specific memories when explicitly asked to recall events from the observer perspective than the field perspective, and that there would be no significant differences on memory perspective for non-depressed individuals. This hypothesis was not supported, but the interaction was significant. Depressed subjects were more likely to provide specific memories when using the field perspective. Future research directions and clinical implications are discussed.","1999","2018-06-18 10:50:08","2018-06-19 10:19:42",NA,"",114,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"University of Houston","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","304531142",NA,NA,"9955899",NA,"; ; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+effect+of+depressed+mood+on+memory+perspective+and+specificity+in+autobiographical+memory+recall%3A++How+we+remember+what+we+remember&issn=&date=1999-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Wagner%2C+Alisha+Lynn&isbn=9780599589551&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=The+effect+of+depressed+mood+on+memory+perspective+and+specificity+in+autobiographical+memory+recall%3A+How+we+remember+what+we+remember&issn=&date=2000-06-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Wagner%2C+Alisha+Lynn&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2000-95012-126&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/304531142?accountid=14182; https://search.proquest.com/docview/619565512?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+effect+of+depressed+mood+on+memory+perspective+and+specificity+in+autobiographical+memory+recall%3A++How+we+remember+what+we+remember&issn=&date=1999-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Wagner%2C+Alisha+Lynn&isbn=9780599589551&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=The+effect+of+depressed+mood+on+memory+perspective+and+specificity+in+autobiographical+memory+recall%3A+How+we+remember+what+we+remember&issn=&date=2000-06-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Wagner%2C+Alisha+Lynn&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2000-95012-126&rft_id=info:doi/","0622:Psychotherapy; 0633:Cognitive therapy; 3300:Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Cognitive therapy; Depressed mood; depressed mood, memory perspective & specificity in autobiographical memory recall, college students; Depression (Emotion); Emotional States; Empirical Study; Human; Memory; Memory perspective; Psychology; Psychotherapy; Recall (Learning); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs)",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For this reason, the involvement of the hippocampus in event memory is thought to depend on its connections with these cortical areas. 15 male rats served as Ss in this experiment. Contrary to these predictions, the authors found that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced lesions of the putative rat homologs of these cortical areas (perirhinal plus postrhinal cortices) did not impair performance on 2 allocentric spatial tasks highly sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction. Remarkably, for one of the tasks there was evidence of a facilitation of performance. The same cortical lesions did, however, disrupt spontaneous object recognition and object discrimination reversal learning but spared initial acquisition of the discrimination. This pattern of results reveals important dissociations between different aspects of memory within the temporal lobe. Furthermore, it shows that the perirhinal-postrhinal cortex is not a necessary route for spatial information reaching the hippocampus and that object familiarityâ€“novelty detection depends on different neural substrates than do other aspects of event memory.

Information represented in the primate hippocampus was analyzed by making recordings in monkeys actively walking. In a sample of 352 cells recorded, no place cells were found, but a considerable population of spatial view cells were found that tuned to respond when the monkey looked at small parts of the environment. Research has demonstrated: (1) these hippocampal neurons respond to a view of space, not to the monkey's location; (2) responses depend on where the monkey is looking; (3) responses in some cases (e.g., CA1 but not CA3) still occur if view details are obscured; (4) cells retain part of their space tuning even in darkness, for several minutes; and (5) spatial representation is allocentric. This representation of space by primate spatial view cells would be an appropriate part of a system involved in memories of particular episodes of where in an environment an object was seen. Spatial view cells (in conjunction with whole body motion cells in the primate hippocampus, and head direction cells in the primate presubiculum) would also be useful as a memory component in a spatial navigation system.

In the tasks, the monkey either freely moved to 1 of 4 reward areas in the experimental field by driving a cab that the monkey rode (real translocation task) or freely moved a pointer to 1 of 4 reward areas on the monitor (virtual translocation task) by manipulating a joystick. Of 389 neurons recorded from the monkey HF and PH, 166 had place fields that displayed increased activity in a specific area in the experimental field and/or on the monitor (location-differential neurons). More HF and PH neurons responded in the real translocation task. These neurons had low mean spontaneous firing rates (0.96 spikes/sec). The remaining nonresponsive neurons had significantly higher mean firing rates (8.39 spikes/sec). Furthermore, most location-differential neurons showed different responses in different tasks. These results suggest that the HF and PH are crucial in allocentric information processing and, moreover, that the HF can encode different reference frames that are context or task-dependent. This may be the neural basis of episodic memory.

In the present research, we compared early and later memories in the same individuals, with the same methodology.

The authors collected autobiographical memories for events in general and for specific, potentially objectifying situations from a predominantly European-American sample of 138 female and 104 male students at a private university. Results demonstrated that female participants reported more observer imagery than male participants both for memories in general and for memories of certain situations wherein women are likely to be sexually objectified. Women's and men's emotional responses to these situations were also different, with women reporting more negative affect, including shame and anxiety, and less positive affect.

Specifically, we propose that their function is to inform the cognitive systems involved in decision-making and action monitoring about the nature and origin of the information being processed. Many studies in experimental psychology, in neuropsychology and in psychopathology bear on impairments of a specific type of memory, distinct from semantic or episodic memory, that we call ""source memory"". The term ""source"" refers to a type of qualitative attributes and dimensions which specify the conditions under which the knowledge has been acquired, namely the perceptive details and contextual information of the representations. These properties which are perceived in a ""first person"" perspective allow to discriminate between memories and general internal knowledge, between imagined events and perceived events, and more generally between self-generated representations and perceptions of external states which have the same representational content. Overall, these studies show that the identification of the source of information plays an important role in a large number of cognitive tasks.

For example, whereas FNX lesions impaired allocentric spatial delayed alternation in a T-maze but generally spared a test of spontaneous object recognition, PPRH lesions produced the opposite pattern of results. Indeed, on the T-maze task PPRH Ss significantly outperformed controls when the retention delay was increased to 60 sec. In addition, some evidence was found that contributions from both the FNX and PPRH may be required when object and spatial information must be integrated. In an object-in-place test, for example, PPRH Ss failed according to 2 measures, and FNX animals failed according to 1 measure, to discriminate objects that had remained in fixed locations from those that had exchanged locations with other objects. It is suggested that the PPRH, rather than being specialized for a particular type of associative learning, is important for processing complex visual stimuli.

Dogs display many of the cognitive impairments associated with human aging and dementia. As well, aged dogs display a wide range of individual variability in cognitive functioning. Different categories of aged canines can be identified on the basis of cognitive test performance, and these categories can be used to model different subgroups of aged dogs. Advantages of a dog model of human cognitive aging include ease of acquisition and maintenance, the lack of deprivation needed for motivation, similar patterns of cognitive decline as a function of age, and similarities between dog- and human-related neuropathologies. The canine model has been examined in studies concerning procedural learning, discrimination and reversal learning, visual recognition memory, allocentric spatial learning, spatial learning and memory, procedural memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, and remote memory. Lesion, neurochemical, and neuropathological studies are currently in progress.

To test these ideas, the authors investigated remote spatial memory in K.C., a 49-yr-old man who became amnesic because of a closed-head injury from a motorcycle accident causing bilateral hippocampal lesions and amnesia for autobiographical events. In his spatial knowledge, general aspects were preserved, but details were lost, a pattern that resembled his memory loss in other domains. K.C. performed normally on allocentric spatial tests of his neighborhood and the world. He had difficulty, however, in recognizing and identifying non-salient neighborhood landmarks, and in recognizing city locations on world maps. This suggests that the hippocampus is not crucial for maintenance and retrieval of remotely formed spatial representations of major landmarks, routes, distances and directions, but is necessary for specifying location details, regardless of when they were acquired.

On the one hand, they can adopt a field vantage point in which they mentally reinstate the memory as if reliving the experience through their own eyes. On the other hand, they can recall the memory as if they were an outside observer watching themselves in the remembered scene.    This thesis used two experimentsâ€”one with normal adults in a controlled laboratory setting and another with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patientsâ€”to examine whether the selection of a particular mental vantage point impacts the contents of one's memory for personal events. To create an episode for recall, participants performed several tasks and then were asked to recall this episode from either the field or the observer vantage point. Following recall, participants indicated how the specified vantage point affected their memory. Two coders analyzed participants' tape-recorded recollections using a scoring key containing a priori content categories on which the vantage point memories were predicted to differ.    Participants' recollections differed as a function of vantage point with field memories containing more information about how they feltâ€”emotionally, physically, psychologically during the task and observer memories focusing more on their actions and appearance, and object locations.    The same analyses were used to assess the memories of a group of patients who met criteria of PTSD. Unlike the laboratory experiment wherein participants were randomly assigned to one of the vantage point groups, here each PTSD patient was allowed to recollect their traumatic experience from the perspective they would naturally choose to use. The analysis of the trauma memories revealed differences in memory contents as a function of vantage point similar to those found in the laboratory experiment: field memories contained more statements about affective reactions, physical sensations, and psychological states during the trauma, while observer memories included more information about object locations and descriptions of the patients watching themselves in the scene. Additionally, observer memories in the PTSD sample included more information peripheral to the traumatic event. The discussion focuses on the implications of these results and prospects for future research.","2001","2018-06-18 10:50:28","2018-06-19 10:15:02",NA,"",86,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"The University of British Columbia (Canada)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","304787029",NA,NA,"NQ71505",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Vantage+point+in+episodic+memory%3A++A+cognitive+and+clinical+investigation&issn=&date=2001-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=McIsaac%2C+Heather+Kathleen&isbn=9780612715059&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/304787029?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Vantage+point+in+episodic+memory%3A++A+cognitive+and+clinical+investigation&issn=&date=2001-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=McIsaac%2C+Heather+Kathleen&isbn=9780612715059&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","0633:Cognitive therapy; Cognitive therapy; Episodic memory; Memory; Psychology; Vantage point",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

He was allowed to explore a large-scale virtual reality town and was then tested on his memory for spatial layout and for episodes experienced. Topographical memory was tested by assessing his ability to navigate, recognize previously visited locations, and draw maps of the town. Episodic memory was assessed by testing the retrieval of simulated events which consisted of collecting objects from characters while following a route through the virtual town. Memory for the identity of objects, as well as for where they were collected, from whom, and in what order, was also tested. While the first task tapped simple recognition memory, the latter three tested memory for context. Jon was impaired on all topographical tasks and on his recall of the context-dependent questions. However, his recognition of objects from the virtual town, and of ""topographical"" scenes (as evaluated by standard neuropsychological tests), was not impaired. These findings are consistent with the view that the hippocampus is involved in navigation, recall of long term allocentric spatial information and context-dependent episodic memory, but not visual pattern matching.","2001","2018-06-18 10:50:29","2018-06-19 10:18:30",NA,"715-725",NA,"6","11",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","72419286; 11811666",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Bilateral+hippocampal+pathology+impairs+topographical+and+episodic+memory+but+not+visual+pattern+matching.&title=Hippocampus&issn=10509631&date=2001-01-01&volume=11&issue=6&spage=715&au=Spiers%2C+H+J%3BBurgess%2C+N%3BHartley%2C+T%3BVargha-Khadem%2C+F%3BO%27Keefe%2C+J&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/11811666&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/72419286?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Bilateral+hippocampal+pathology+impairs+topographical+and+episodic+memory+but+not+visual+pattern+matching.&title=Hippocampus&issn=10509631&date=2001-01-01&volume=11&issue=6&spage=715&au=Spiers%2C+H+J%3BBurgess%2C+N%3BHartley%2C+T%3BVargha-Khadem%2C+F%3BO%27Keefe%2C+J&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/11811666&rft_id=info:doi/; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.1087","*Dominance, Cerebral; Adult; Brain Diseases -- physiopathology; Brain Diseases -- psychology; Brain Diseases/*physiopathology/*psychology; Child; Discrimination (Psychology) -- physiology; Discrimination (Psychology)/physiology; Dominance, Cerebral; Hippocampus -- physiopathology; Hippocampus/*physiopathology; Humans; Index Medicus; Male; Memory -- physiology; Memory/*physiology; Mental Recall -- physiology; Mental Recall/physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual -- physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/*physiology; Recognition (Psychology) -- physiology; Recognition (Psychology)/physiology; Space Perception -- physiology; Space Perception/physiology; User-Computer Interface",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

F. Loftus and J. Pickrell (1995). Participants recalled events provided by parents on 3 separate occasions and were asked to imagine true and false unremembered events. True memories were rated by both participants and observers as more rich in recollective experience and were rated by participants as more important, more emotionally intense, as having clearer imagery, and as less typical than false memories. Rehearsal frequency was used as a covariate, eliminating these effects. Imagery in true memories was most often viewed from the field perspective, whereas imagery in false memories was most often viewed from the observer perspective. More information was communicated in true memories, and true memories contained more information concerning the consequences of described events. Results suggest repeated remembering can make false memories more rich in recollective experience and more like true memories. Differences between true and false memories suggest some potentially distinct characteristics of false memories and provide insight into the process of false memory creation.

These ideas are reviewed and related to several general aspects of episodic memory, including the differences between episodic, recognition and semantic memory, and whether hippocampal lesions differentially affect recent or remote memories. Some outstanding questions remain, such as: what characterizes episodic retrieval as opposed to other forms of read-out from memory; what triggers the storage of an event memory; and what are the neural mechanisms involved? To address these questions a neural-level model of the medial temporal and parietal roles in retrieval of the spatial context of an event is presented. This model combines the idea that retrieval of the rich context of real-life events is a central characteristic of episodic memory, and the idea that medial temporal allocentric representations are used in long-term storage while parietal egocentric representations are used to imagine, manipulate and re-experience the products of retrieval. The model is consistent with the known neural representation of spatial information in the brain, and provides an explanation for the involvement of Papez's circuit in both the representation of heading direction and in the recollection of episodic information. Two experiments relating to the model are briefly described. A functional neuroimaging study of memory for the spatial context of life-like events in virtual reality provides support for the model's functional localization. A neuropsychological experiment suggests that the hippocampus does store an allocentric representation of spatial locations.","2001-09-29","2018-06-18 10:50:33","2018-06-18 12:29:28",NA,"1493-1503",NA,"1413","356",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","71196523; 11571039",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Memory+for+events+and+their+spatial+context%3A+models+and+experiments.&title=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&issn=09628436&date=2001-09-29&volume=356&issue=1413&spage=1493&au=Burgess%2C+N%3BBecker%2C+S%3BKing%2C+J+A%3BO%27Keefe%2C+J&isbn=&jtitle=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/11571039&rft_id=info:doi/; http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/356/1413/1493.full.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/71196523?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Memory+for+events+and+their+spatial+context%3A+models+and+experiments.&title=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&issn=09628436&date=2001-09-29&volume=356&issue=1413&spage=1493&au=Burgess%2C+N%3BBecker%2C+S%3BKing%2C+J+A%3BO%27Keefe%2C+J&isbn=&jtitle=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/11571039&rft_id=info:doi/","Humans; Index Medicus; Hippocampus -- physiology; Animals; Space Perception -- physiology; Mental Recall -- physiology; Models, Neurological; Hippocampus/*physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; *Models, Neurological",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Also examined was current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Results show that extreme memorial variability was found both within and across the types of reported memories and perspectives. Dissociation at the time of both sexual and non-sexual traumas was significantly related to total PTSD symptomatology. There was a significant relation between dissociating during sexual trauma and subsequent avoidance symptoms, but not in terms of intrusion symptoms. Subjects' trait dissociative tendencies were significantly related to their state dissociative reactions during sexual traumas. All 3 types of memories, and, in particular, traumatic memories, that were perceived from an observer perspective contained significantly higher levels of state dissociation.

A similar pattern emerged when participants imagined performing actions that varied in self-concept compatibility (Study 4). The authors conclude that on-line judgments of an action's self-concept compatibility affect the perspective used for image construction. Study 5 shows applied implications. Use of the 3rd-person perspective when recalling past episodes of overindulgent eating was related to optimism about behaving differently at an upcoming Thanksgiving dinner. The authors discuss the effect of self-concept compatibility on cognitive and emotional reactions to past actions and consider the role of causal attributions in defining the self across time.

In the former case, the Ss mentally reinstated the original task environment as if they were seeing it again through their own eyes; in the latter condition, the original task environment was envisioned from the perspective of a detached spectator. Analysis of the Ss' recollections revealed marked differences in the contents of field and observer memories. For instance, whereas field memories afforded richer accounts of the affective reactions, physical sensations, and psychological states that the Ss experienced as they performed the tasks, observer memories included more information about how the Ss looked, what they did, or where things were. Discussion focuses on prospects for future research whose aim would be to investigate the forensic and clinical implications of the field/observer distinction.

The studies presented in this dissertation suggest some literal truth to this idea, and also some implications for the way people experience and judge change in themselves over time. When people visually imagine or remember their own actions, they may use the first-person perspective (looking through their own eyes) or the third-person perspective (observer's visual perspective). People may also construe any given action (e.g., writing a paper) in different ways that range from concrete (e.g., pushing keys on the keyboard) to abstract (e.g., expressing one's self). In Chapter 2, three studies show that first-person visualization of one's own actions both leads to and is produced by concrete construals of those actions; third-person visualization both leads to and is produced by abstract construals. Chapter 3 describes research my colleagues and I have conducted which links imagery perspective in autobiographical memory to self-concept change: Perceptions of change in the self both influence and are influenced by the visual perspective people use to recall past autobiographical events. Chapters 4 and 5 suggest that these effects may arise due to the relationship between imagery perspective and construal level. In Chapter 4 participants were more likely to think about their own past actions in abstract terms if they had changed since the recalled event occurred than if they had not, and this difference caused people who had changed to be more likely to recall from the third-person perspective. Chapter 5 manipulated abstraction level of past behaviorâ€”instead of memory perspectiveâ€”but affected self-change judgments in the same was as memory perspective manipulations do, suggesting that memory perspective induction influences self-change judgments by changing the meaning of one's own past behavior. Chapter 6 explores the implications of these findings for the construction of future selves, cross-cultural differences in the self-concept, social judgment, and approaches to studying the self-concept.","2003","2018-06-18 10:50:43","2018-06-19 10:14:19",NA,"",135,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cornell University","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","305341324",NA,NA,"3075889",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Seeing+meaning%3A+Imagery+perspective%2C+action+identification%2C+and+perceptions+of+change+in+the+self&issn=&date=2003-06-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Libby%2C+Lisa+Kathryn&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2003-95012-267&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/620231948?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Seeing+meaning%3A++Imagery+perspective%2C+action+identification%2C+and+perceptions+of+change+in+the+self&issn=&date=2003-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Libby%2C+Lisa+Kathryn&isbn=9780493961828&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Seeing+meaning%3A+Imagery+perspective%2C+action+identification%2C+and+perceptions+of+change+in+the+self&issn=&date=2003-06-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Libby%2C+Lisa+Kathryn&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2003-95012-267&rft_id=info:doi/","0451:Social psychology; 0625:Personality; 0633:Cognitive therapy; 3000:Social Psychology; 3100:Personality Psychology; action identification; Action identification; Autobiographical Memory; Cognitive therapy; Cross Cultural Differences; first-person perspective; first-person visualization; Human; Imagery; imagery perspective; Judgment; Meaning; Personality; Psychology; Self; self-concept; Self-Concept; Self-Perception; Social psychology; third-person perspective",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

On the one hand, they can adopt a field vantage point in which they mentally reinstate the memory as if reliving the experience through their own eyes. On the other hand, they can recall the memory as if they were an outside observer watching themselves in the remembered scene. This thesis used two experiments-one with normal adults in a controlled laboratory setting and another with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients-to examine whether the selection of a particular mental vantage point impacts the contents of one's memory for personal events. To create an episode for recall, participants performed several tasks and then were asked to recall this episode from either the field or the observer vantage point. Following recall, participants indicated how the specified vantage point affected their memory. Two coders analyzed participants' tape-recorded recollections using a scoring key containing a priori content categories on which the vantage point memories were predicted to differ. Participants' recollections differed as a function of vantage point with field memories containing more information about how they felt-emotionally, physically, psychologically during the task and observer memories focusing more on their actions and appearance, and object locations. The same analyses were used to assess the memories of a group of patients who met criteria of PTSD. Unlike the laboratory experiment wherein participants were randomly assigned to one of the vantage point groups, here each PTSD patient was allowed to recollect their traumatic experience from the perspective they would naturally choose to use. The analysis of the trauma memories revealed differences in memory contents as a function of vantage point similar to those found in the laboratory experiment: field memories contained more statements about affective reactions, physical sensations, and psychological states during the trauma, while observer memories included more information about object locations and descriptions of the patients watching themselves in the scene. Additionally, observer memories in the PTSD sample included more information peripheral to the traumatic event. The discussion focuses on the implications of these results and prospects for future research.

Both groups answered a questionnaire addressing the recollective quality, integration and coherence of the traumatic memory that currently affected them most. Participants with a PTSD symptom profile reported more vivid recollection of emotion and sensory impressions. They reported more observer perspective in the memory (seeing themselves 'from the outside'), but no more fragmentation. They also agreed more with the statement that the trauma had become part of their identity, and perceived more thematic connections between the trauma and current events in their lives.

By contrast, memory for topographical details, such as houses, was lost, which may relate to K.C.'s inability to retrieve autobiographical details from any time in his life. Findings of spared performance may reflect the function of brain structures outside of the hippocampus that are intact in K.C. and that have been implicated in spatial cognition, whereas impaired memory for spatial and autobiographical details may reflect a more general visual imagery or strategic retrieval deficit. To explore these possibilities, the network of brain structures supporting remote spatial memory was examined in fMRI experiments of healthy adults (Chapter Two), in behavioural studies involving an Alzheimer's disease patient (S.B.) who was once a taxi driver (Chapter Three), and in combined lesion and fMRI investigations of patient K.C. (Chapter Four). Tasks believed to place different emphasis on the neural correlates of spatial representations were used, including: (1)Â landmark recognition, involving a sector of occipitotemporal cortex, (2)Â allocentric distance judgments, governed by parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortex, and (3)Â egocentric route navigation, within posterior parietal regions. As predicted, remote memory recruited the topographical neural network based on the processing demands of each task in the fMRI studies and was dissociable based on S.B.'s lesion profile, with impaired landmark recognition but intact allocentric and egocentric processing. Moreover, in line with the preservation observed in S.B., no hippocampal activity was evident in K.C. though he has part of his hippocampus still remaining. Chapter Five investigated whether K.C.'s profound deficits in house recognition and autobiographical memory are symptomatic of widespread damage to medial occipital and frontal cortex, rather than loss of hippocampal tissue. However, performance was normal on visual imagery testing, and autobiographical memory did not benefit from a retrieval support manipulation, contrary to what would be expected if respective medial occipital or frontal lesions were responsible. Taken together, this research informs theories of hippocampal and neocortical contributions to remote memory.","2004","2018-06-18 10:50:49","2018-06-19 10:17:34",NA,"",283,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"University of Toronto (Canada)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","305071195",NA,NA,"NQ91832",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Investigations+of+remote+memory+for+topographical+and+autobiographical+information%3A+Evidence+from+functional+magnetic+resonance+imaging+and+amnesic+patients&issn=&date=2004-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Rosenbaum%2C+Rachel+Shayna&isbn=0612918327&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/305071195?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Investigations+of+remote+memory+for+topographical+and+autobiographical+information%3A+Evidence+from+functional+magnetic+resonance+imaging+and+amnesic+patients&issn=&date=2004-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Rosenbaum%2C+Rachel+Shayna&isbn=0612918327&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Investigations+of+remote+memory+for+topographical+and+autobiographical+information%3A+Evidence+from+functional+magnetic+resonance+imaging+and+amnesic+patients&issn=&date=2004-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Rosenbaum%2C+Rachel+Shayna&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2004-99022-328&rft_id=info:doi/","0623:Experiments; 0623:Psychology; 2300:Human Experimental Psychology; Amnesia; Amnesic; amnesic patients; autobiographical information; Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Clinical Case Study; cognitive map; Cognitive Maps; Empirical Study; Experiments; hippocampal amnesia; Hippocampus; Human; Imagery; impaired memory; Magnetic resonance imaging; Memory Decay; Psychology; Remote memory; remote spatial memory; Spatial cognition; Spatial Memory; Topographical; topographical information; Topography; visual imagery",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contrasting the fMRI images obtained during the navigation trials with appropriate control conditions revealed a bilateral network comprising the parietal lobe (including the intraparietal sulcus) and various lateral and medial premotor areas. The subjects using an allocentric strategy showed stronger activation in the medial temporal areas including the parahippocampal region, the hippocampus, and the thalamus. In addition, the cerebellum was also active in those subjects. We believe that this activation pattern is related to visually guided memory retrieval based on generalized spatial maps. The stronger activation in the thalamic-basal ganglia-cerebellar-loop points to a more automatic support of memory and attentional processes possibly supporting memorization of spatial maps.

These components can be difficult to dissociate using retrospective autobiographical stimuli collection. In this study, we manipulated the episodic/semantic distinction within prospectively collected autobiographical stimuli. Over several months, participants made recordings documenting specific episodes, repeated episodes, and world knowledge. These recordings were later played back to participants during scanning with functional MRI. The results indicated overlapping but distinct patterns of brain activity corresponding to episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. Both episodic and semantic autobiographical memory engaged the left anteromedial prefrontal cortex associated with self-reference, but the episodic condition did so to a greater degree. The episodic condition uniquely engaged the medial temporal, posterior cingulate, and diencephalic regions associated with remote memory recovery. Whereas the episodic condition engaged the right temporo-parietal cortex involved in reconstruction of spatial context and attentional orienting, the semantic condition engaged the left temporo-parietal and parieto-frontal systems involved in egocentric spatial processing and topdown attentional control. Episodic recollection was also associated with suppression of emotional paralimbic regions. These findings support a functional neuroanatomical dissociation between episodic and semantic autobiographical memory, providing concordance to amnesic syndromes with disproportionate impairment in one of these two forms of autobiographical memory.

Memories from an observer perspective involve seeing oneself in the original event as if from an external point of view; memories from a field perspective involve recalling the event as if viewing it through one's own eyes. Sixty-one patients with chronic pain were asked to (1) recall a painful memory, (2) indicate whether they saw themselves in the memory (observer mode) or re-experienced events of the memory from the first-person perspective (field mode), and (3) rate various phenomenologic properties of the memory. Twenty of these pain patients were also given two frontal lobe tests to examine potential neuropsychologic correlates of memory retrieval preferences. Memory retrieval in the field mode was associated with (a) significantly higher self-reported pain scores on the McGill Pain Questionnaire, (b) nonright-handedness, and (c) poorer performance on the tests of frontal function. Patients with chronic pain who adopt the field mode of memory retrieval when recalling painful memories experience greater current pain severity than chronic pain patients who adopt observer retrieval strategies. Those adopting field retrieval strategies may also evidence frontal system neuropsychologic anomalies.

Recently, our laboratory demonstrated that, analogous to event-place associations in episodic memory, rats could associate, within one trial, a specific food flavor with an allocentrically defined place in an open arena. Encoding, but not retrieval, of such flavor-place associations required hippocampal NMDA receptors; retrieval depended on hippocampal AMPA receptors. This might have partly reflected the contributions of these receptors to encoding and retrieval of one-trial place, rather than flavor-place, memory. Therefore, the present study developed a food-reinforced arena paradigm to study encoding and retrieval of one-trial allocentric place memory in rats; memory relied on visuospatial information and declined with increasing retention delay, still being significant after 6 h, the longest delay tested (experiments 1 and 2). Hippocampal infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP-5 blocked encoding without affecting retrieval; hippocampal infusion of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX impaired retrieval (experiment 3). Finally, we confirmed that the D-AP-5 infusions selectively blocked induction of long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity, whereas CNQX impaired fast excitatory transmission, at perforant-path dentate gyrus synapses in the dorsal hippocampus in vivo (experiment 4). Our results support that encoding, but not retrieval, of one-trial allocentric place memory requires the NMDA receptor-dependent induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, whereas retrieval depends on AMPA receptor-mediated fast excitatory hippocampal transmission. The contributions of hippocampal NMDA and AMPA receptors to one-trial allocentric place memory may be central to episodic memory and related episodic-like forms of memory in rats.

Recordings were made from single hippocampal formation neurons while macaques performed an object-place memory task that required the monkeys to learn associations between objects and where they were shown in a room. Some neurons (10%) responded differently to different objects independently of location; other neurons (13%) responded to the spatial view independently of which object was present at the location; and some neurons (12%) responded to a combination of a particular object and the place where it was shown in the room. These results show that there are separate as well as combined representations of objects and their locations in space in the primate hippocampus. This is a property required in an episodic memory system, for which associations between objects and the places where they are seen are prototypical. The results thus provide an important advance by showing that a requirement for a human episodic memory system, separate and combined neuronal representations of objects and where they are seen ""out there"" in the environment, is present in the primate hippocampus.

We examine episodic, semantic and spatial memory, and show that important distinctions exist among different types of these memories and the structures that mediate them. We argue that retention and retrieval of detailed, vivid autobiographical memories depend on the hippocampal system no matter how long ago they were acquired. Semantic memories, on the other hand, benefit from hippocampal contribution for some time before they can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus. Even semantic memories, however, can have episodic elements associated with them that continue to depend on the hippocampus. Likewise, we distinguish between experientially detailed spatial memories (akin to episodic memory) and more schematic memories (akin to semantic memory) that are sufficient for navigation but not for re-experiencing the environment in which they were acquired. Like their episodic and semantic counterparts, the former type of spatial memory is dependent on the hippocampus no matter how long ago it was acquired, whereas the latter can survive independently of the hippocampus and is represented in extra-hippocampal structures. In short, the evidence reviewed suggests strongly that the function of the hippocampus (and possibly that of related limbic structures) is to help encode, retain, and retrieve experiences, no matter how long ago the events comprising the experience occurred, and no matter whether the memories are episodic or spatial. We conclude that the evidence favours a multiple trace theory (MTT) of memory over two other models: (1) traditional consolidation models which posit that the hippocampus is a time-limited memory structure for all forms of memory; and (2) versions of cognitive map theory which posit that the hippocampus is needed for representing all forms of allocentric space in memory.","2005-07","2018-06-18 10:51:09","2018-06-19 10:15:24",NA,"35-66",NA,"1","207",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","68028929; 16011544",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Functional+neuroanatomy+of+remote+episodic%2C+semantic+and+spatial+memory%3A+a+unified+account+based+on+multiple+trace+theory.&title=Journal+of+anatomy&issn=00218782&date=2005-07-01&volume=207&issue=1&spage=35&au=Moscovitch%2C+Morris%3BRosenbaum%2C+R+Shayna%3BGilboa%2C+Asaf%3BAddis%2C+Donna+Rose%3BWestmacott%2C+Robyn%3BGrady%2C+Cheryl%3BMcAndrews%2C+Mary+Pat%3BLevine%2C+Brian%3BBlack%2C+Sandra%3BWinocur%2C+Gordon%3BNadel%2C+Lynn&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+anatomy&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/16011544&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/68028929?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Functional+neuroanatomy+of+remote+episodic%2C+semantic+and+spatial+memory%3A+a+unified+account+based+on+multiple+trace+theory.&title=Journal+of+anatomy&issn=00218782&date=2005-07-01&volume=207&issue=1&spage=35&au=Moscovitch%2C+Morris%3BRosenbaum%2C+R+Shayna%3BGilboa%2C+Asaf%3BAddis%2C+Donna+Rose%3BWestmacott%2C+Robyn%3BGrady%2C+Cheryl%3BMcAndrews%2C+Mary+Pat%3BLevine%2C+Brian%3BBlack%2C+Sandra%3BWinocur%2C+Gordon%3BNadel%2C+Lynn&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+anatomy&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/16011544&rft_id=info:doi/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1571502/pdf/joa_421.pdf","*Models, Psychological; Amnesia -- physiopathology; Amnesia/physiopathology; Diencephalon -- physiology; Diencephalon/physiology; Hippocampus -- physiology; Hippocampus/*physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory -- physiology; Memory/*physiology; Models, Psychological; Neuropsychological Tests; Positron-Emission Tomography; Semantics; Temporal Lobe -- physiology; Temporal Lobe/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The provision of allocentric representations in spatial memory and context-dependent memory for episodic events were each investigated, both for themselves and with the aim of identifying any commonalities in hippocampal function. Inspired by the similarity of human memory for location and the allocentric representations in the hippocampi of freely moving rats, a difficulty-matched spatial memory test was developed to compare allocentric performance requiring viewpoint- independent representations of location with performance for which viewpoint-dependent representations suffice. It was shown that hippocampal damage leads to a specific impairment in the allocentric condition. This test also indicated that topographical disorientation can result from a selective deficit in allocentric spatial memory, and is under continued development for early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Episodic memory was investigated in three ways. First, the way in which different aspects of an event are bound together, holistic or fragmented, was investigated using a virtual reality test of context-dependent memory. We found fragmented representations and distinct retrieval hierarchies. Second, the hippocampal involvement in personally relevant memories was investigated with fMRI, using personally known, famous and unknown faces as cues. Extensive hippocampal activation was found for both personally known and famous faces, most likely reflecting the vividness and semantic embedding of memories cued by these stimuli. Third, hippocampal involvement in multimodal context-dependent memory was investigated using fMRI of memory for events occurring in different spatial and olfactory contexts. Extensive, partially overlapping, hippocampal activation was associated with retrieval of both types of context. The results are discussed in terms of the hippocampal role in memory, its laterality, and the relationship between viewpoint independence, multi-modal context and semantic embedding in retrieval.","2006","2018-06-18 10:51:11","2018-06-19 10:19:12",NA,"",230,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"University of London, University College London (United Kingdom)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1429534273",NA,NA,"U593466",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Hippocampal-dependent+spatial+and+episodic+memory+in+humans&issn=&date=2006-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Trinkler%2C+Iris&isbn=9781303388064&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1429534273?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Hippocampal-dependent+spatial+and+episodic+memory+in+humans&issn=&date=2006-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Trinkler%2C+Iris&isbn=9781303388064&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Hippocampal-dependent+spatial+and+episodic+memory+in+humans&issn=&date=2006-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Trinkler%2C+I.&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","(UMI)AAIU593466; 0317:Neurosciences; Biological sciences; DXN100962; Episodic memory; Hippocampus; Neurosciences; Psychology--Abstracting, Bibliographies, Statistics; Spatial memory",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The phenomenology of a memory, independent of its affective and motivational content, has been of interest to psychologists in multiple areas of psychology; yet popular measures of phenomenology have severe theoretical and psychometric shortcomings that limit their usefulness. The present research reports the development of a psychometrically sound and valid measure of memory phenomenology and presents additional theoretical and empirical evidence for one of the identified phenomenological dimensions: visual perspective.   Chapter 1 reports the development of the Memory Experiences Questionnaire (MEQ). Ten phenomenological dimensions were identified from the memory literature: Vividness, Coherence, Accessibility, Sensory Detail, Emotional Intensity, Visual Perspective, Time Perspective, Sharing, Distancing, and Valence. Evidence from four studies indicates (a)Â all 10 scales had good reliability, (b)Â the 10-factor structure provided the best fit to the data; (c)Â gender, personality, and memory recency had theoretically meaningful relations with the 10 scales.    Chapter 2 more fully develops the phenomenological dimension of visual perspective. A growing body of research suggests that the visual perspective from which a memory is retrieved has important implications for a person's thoughts, feelings, and goals; the field, however, lacks an integrative theoretical framework. This chapter reviews the research on visual perspective, introduces a new theoretical model of the self processes involved in autobiographical memories, proposes competing hypotheses about the role of visual perspective in the retrieval of autobiographical memories, and identifies directions for future research on visual perspective.

Using the MEQ and a large sample (N = 650), naturally retrieved 1st person and 3rd person memories were compared. First-person memories were higher than 3rd person memories on eight of the phenomenological dimensions (Vividness, Coherence, Accessibility, Sensory Detail, Emotional Intensity, Visual Perspective, Time Perspective, and Sharing) and lower on one dimension (Distancing), indicating that the phenomenological experience of a memory differs by the visual perspective from which it is retrieved.","2006","2018-06-18 10:51:14","2018-06-19 10:18:52",NA,"",91,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"University of California, Davis","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","305368293",NA,NA,"3230697",NA,"; ; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+phenomenology+of+autobiographical+memory&issn=&date=2006-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Sutin%2C+Angelina+Raquel&isbn=9780542845376&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=The+phenomenology+of+autobiographical+memory&issn=&date=2007-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Sutin%2C+Angelina+Raquel&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2007-99006-052&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/305368293?accountid=14182; https://search.proquest.com/docview/622011896?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+phenomenology+of+autobiographical+memory&issn=&date=2006-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Sutin%2C+Angelina+Raquel&isbn=9780542845376&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=The+phenomenology+of+autobiographical+memory&issn=&date=2007-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Sutin%2C+Angelina+Raquel&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2007-99006-052&rft_id=info:doi/","0625:Personality; 0632:Psychological tests; 0633:Cognitive therapy; 2340:Cognitive Processes; 3100:Personality Psychology; achievement; Achievement; Auditory Stimulation; autobiographical memory; Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Cognitive therapy; Empirical Study; Human; Memory; motivational content; Personality; phenomenology; Phenomenology; Psychological tests; Psychologists; Psychology; psychometric shortcomings; Psychometrics; Quantitative Study; Questionnaires; Visual perspective",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Relatively unaffected by the understanding of experience formed within the parameters of language and adult thought, and dominated by preoperational thought, childhood imagination defines early experience in uniquely human and individual terms. Imagination at this time is flexible and can be used to organize experience in multiple sensory and egocentric dimensions. In the usual course of events, childhood imagination becomes more socialized and organized by less egocentric dimensions of thought and more stable, social interpersonal dimensions. However, the original richness of childhood imagination can still contribute to adult experience. In this book we address an event in childhood--the death and emotional loss of a significant family member--that disrupts this developmental course, with the result that a child's imagination is restricted, yet in some ways intensely enriched, by memories of the past. Idiosyncratic in nature, these memories continue into adulthood. This childhood experience of grief and mourning frequently results in clinical evaluation and interventions, and these procedures are used in this text as methods for studying imagination. The enduring effect of this early experience can also find expression in adult imagination. Under certain conditions, adults will use their memory for a creative reconstruction of this childhood experience. We use the lives and literary works of four authors to illustrate the profound effect of this childhood experience on adult imagination and creativity.

The responses depend on where the monkey is looking; and can be updated by idiothetic (self-motion) inputs provided by eye movements when the view is hidden. In a room-based object-place memory task, some hippocampal neurons respond to the objects shown, some to the places viewed, and some to combinations of the places viewed and the objects present in those locations. In an object-place recall task when the location in space at which an object has been seen is recalled by the presentation of the object, some primate hippocampal neurons maintain their responding to the object recall cue in a delay period without the object visible while the place is being recalled; and other neurons respond to the place being recalled. Other spatial view neurons form associations with the rewards present at particular locations in space. These findings, and computational models of the hippocampus, help to show how the primate including human hippocampus is involved in episodic memory.","2006","2018-06-18 10:51:16","2018-06-19 10:17:17",NA,"175-200",NA,"1-2","17",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","67980352; 16703951",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Spatial+view+cells+in+the+primate+hippocampus+and+memory+recall.&title=Reviews+in+the+neurosciences&issn=03341763&date=2006-01-01&volume=17&issue=1-2&spage=175&au=Rolls%2C+Edmund+T%3BXiang%2C+J+Z&isbn=&jtitle=Reviews+in+the+neurosciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/16703951&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/67980352?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Spatial+view+cells+in+the+primate+hippocampus+and+memory+recall.&title=Reviews+in+the+neurosciences&issn=03341763&date=2006-01-01&volume=17&issue=1-2&spage=175&au=Rolls%2C+Edmund+T%3BXiang%2C+J+Z&isbn=&jtitle=Reviews+in+the+neurosciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/16703951&rft_id=info:doi/","Action Potentials -- physiology; Action Potentials/physiology; Animals; Hippocampus -- anatomy & histology; Hippocampus -- physiology; Hippocampus/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Memory -- physiology; Memory/*physiology; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways -- anatomy & histology; Neural Pathways -- physiology; Neural Pathways/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Neurons -- physiology; Neurons/*physiology; Orientation -- physiology; Orientation/physiology; Primates -- anatomy & histology; Primates -- physiology; Primates/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Reward; Space Perception -- physiology; Space Perception/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This cortical area has traditionally received little attention, mainly because of its hidden location and the virtual absence of focal lesion studies. However, recent functional imaging findings in healthy subjects suggest a central role for the precuneus in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval and self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. Furthermore, precuneus and surrounding posteromedial areas are amongst the brain structures displaying the highest resting metabolic rates (hot spots) and are characterized by transient decreases in the tonic activity during engagement in non-self-referential goal-directed actions (default mode of brain function). Therefore, it has recently been proposed that precuneus is involved in the interwoven network of the neural correlates of self-consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of altered conscious states, such as sleep, drug-induced anaesthesia and vegetative states. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of precuneus, together with its wide-spread connectivity with both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by connectional and neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, and links these notions with the multifaceted spectrum of its behavioural correlates. By means of a critical analysis of precuneus activation patterns in response to different mental tasks, this paper provides a useful conceptual framework for matching the functional imaging findings with the specific role(s) played by this structure in the higher-order cognitive functions in which it has been implicated. Specifically, activation patterns appear to converge with anatomical and connectivity data in providing preliminary evidence for a functional subdivision within the precuneus into an anterior region, involved in self-centred mental imagery strategies, and a posterior region, subserving successful episodic memory retrieval.

However, these studies did not assess the subjective experience associated with remembering. In this study, people with social phobia and non-anxious control participants recalled social and non-social events, and rated the phenomenal characteristics of their memories. The memories of people with social phobia for social events contained fewer sensorial details but more self-referential information than controls' memories. In addition, people with social phobia remembered social situations from an observer perspective, viewing themselves as if from outside, to a greater extent than controls. By contrast, the two groups did not differ concerning their memories for non-social events. These findings are discussed in relation to cognitive models of social phobia.

While the number of studies focusing on this phenomenological aspect of retrieval has increased in the last decade, a basic understanding of the meaning of perspective and its fundamental characteristics has not been fully established. The current studies attempt to further this understanding. The first series of studies examine the role of memory age in perspective using continuous scales to measure self-reported perspective. These studies show memories change in a linear fashion, from first- to third-person perspective, as memories become more remote. Furthermore, individuals report more than one perspective during a single retrieval episode, females report more third-person perspective than do males, and individual differences in perspective use were observed. These individual differences were not accounted for by personality differences, such as levels of public self-consciousness. A second series of studies asked participants to describe the location of their visual perspective, rather than using continuous scales. These studies show visual perspective location varies greatly and consistently across space and for different events. For example, memories of giving a presentation were more likely to be visualized from in front of the individual, whereas memories of running from a threat were visualized from behind the individual. Although perspective location varies across events and space, location did not affect other phenomenological aspects of retrieval, such as memory vividness, belief in the accuracy of one's memory, or the degree of reliving experienced, nor did location map onto the ideal location for watching an event unfold or for watching one's self complete a task. Together these studies further characterize visual perspective during retrieval, suggesting it is more complex than a simple, dichotomous distinction between first- and third-person perspective. Additionally, they highlight the importance of understanding the phenomenological experience of perspective in order to appreciate its significance in other domains.","2007","2018-06-18 10:51:26","2018-06-19 10:16:38",NA,"",222,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Duke University","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","304863561",NA,NA,"3254730",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Measuring+visual+perspective+in+autobiographical+memory+across+time+periods+and+events&issn=&date=2007-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Rice%2C+Heather+Joy&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Measuring+visual+perspective+in+autobiographical+memory+across+time+periods+and+events&issn=&date=2007-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Rice%2C+Heather+Joy&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Measuring+visual+perspective+in+autobiographical+memory+across+time+periods+and+events&issn=&date=2007-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Rice%2C+Heather+Joy&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2007-99016-315&rft_id=info:doi/","0633:Cognitive therapy; 2340:Cognitive Processes; autobiographical memory; Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Cognitive therapy; Empirical Study; events; Human; Memory; Psychology; Research; Time; time periods; Visual Perception; visual perspective; Visual perspective; Visualization",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This fMRI study examined the neural regions mediating the construction and elaboration of past and future events. Participants were cued with a noun for 20 s and instructed to construct a past or future event within a specified time period (week, year, 5-20 years). Once participants had the event in mind, they made a button press and for the remainder of the 20 s elaborated on the event. Importantly, all events generated were episodic and did not differ on a number of phenomenological qualities (detail, emotionality, personal significance, field/observer perspective). Conjunction analyses indicated the left hippocampus was commonly engaged by past and future event construction, along with posterior visuospatial regions, but considerable neural differentiation was also observed during the construction phase. Future events recruited regions involved in prospective thinking and generation processes, specifically right frontopolar cortex and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, respectively. Furthermore, future event construction uniquely engaged the right hippocampus, possibly as a response to the novelty of these events. In contrast to the construction phase, elaboration was characterized by remarkable overlap in regions comprising the autobiographical memory retrieval network, attributable to the common processes engaged during elaboration, including self-referential processing, contextual and episodic imagery. This striking neural overlap is consistent with findings that amnesic patients exhibit deficits in both past and future thinking, and confirms that the episodic system contributes importantly to imagining the future.

We conducted a thorough study of autobiographical memory in severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, examined at least one year post-trauma. Twenty-five patients were submitted to a novel and controlled autobiographical procedure specially designed to measure episodic memories (i.e., unique, specific in time and space, and detailed) from their entire life span with two kinds of self-remembering experience. The ability to mentally travel back through time and re-experience the source of acquisition, i.e. autonoetic consciousness, was assessed via the ""Remember/Know"" paradigm and a checking procedure of sense of remembering. Self-perspective in visual imagery, which is also critically involved in episodic recollection, was assessed by the ""Field/Observer perspective"" paradigm. In addition, the patients underwent a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests to assess episodic and semantic memory, orientation and executive functions. The results showed that the patients, compared with healthy controls, were significantly impaired in recalling episodic autobiographical memories. This impairment was not related to the life period tested or the patients' ages nor the intellectual impairment. Deficits involved disturbances in sense of remembering, visual imagery self-perspective and recollection of spatiotemporal details. Stepwise-regression analyses carried out in the TBI patients revealed a significant relationship between an abnormal sense of remembering and executive dysfunction covering both anterograde and retrograde components. The novel assessment used in this study provides the first detailed evidence of a more fine-grained deficit of autobiographical memory in TBI patients. Indeed, the results suggest that these patients, long after trauma, present autonoetic consciousness and self-perspective disorders, which include sense of identity (the self) as a continuous entity across time, probably related to frontal dysfunction.

On the eve of the 2004 U.S. presidential election, registered voters in Ohio were instructed to use either the first-person or the third-person perspective to picture themselves voting in the election. Picturing voting from the third-person perspective caused subjects to adopt a stronger pro-voting mind-set correspondent with the imagined behavior. Further, this effect on self-perception carried over to behavior, causing subjects who were instructed to picture voting from the third-person perspective to be significantly more likely to vote in the election. These findings extend previous research in autobiographical memory and social judgment linking the observer's perspective with dispositional attributions, and demonstrate the causal role of imagery in determining future behavior.

In contrast, proponents of the Multiple Trace Theory (Fuji, Moscovitch, & Nadel, 2000, Handbook of neuropsychology, 2nd ed., p 223, Amsterdam, New York: Elsevier; Nadel & Moscovitch, 1999, Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 7, 217) posit that the mesial temporal lobe (MTL) is necessary for remembering detailed autobiographical and topographical material from all time periods. A third theory of hippocampal function, the Cognitive Map Theory (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978, The hippocampus as a cognitive map. Oxford: Clarendon), states that the hippocampus is involved in the processing of allocentric spatial representations. The precise role of the MTL in remote memory has been difficult to elucidate, as the majority of studies present cases with widespread brain damage that often occurred many years prior to testing. We investigated retrograde autobiographical, semantic and topographical memories in a subject (SG) who had recently sustained infarctions confined to the MTL and retrosplenial region bilaterally. Inconsistent with the predictions of Cognitive Map Theory, memory for spatial maps that were learned in the past was preserved. Additional testing indicated that SG suffered from a landmark agnosia, which affected remotely and recently acquired information equally. SG was also poor at imagining which direction he would have to turn his body to move from one landmark to another. In accordance with Consolidation Theory, SG performed similarly to control subjects for remote time periods on various measures of retrograde autobiographical memory and demonstrated intact knowledge regarding famous faces and vocabulary terms that were acquired in the past. In contrast, memory for remote public events was impaired. The current findings indicate that the mesial temporal and/or retrosplenial regions have little role to play in memory for remotely acquired spatial maps, autobiographical memories, famous faces or vocabulary terms. However, the findings for landmark naming, directional calculations between landmarks and knowledge of public events suggest that the MTL and/or retrosplenial cortices remain important for accessing these types of memories indefinitely.

The present research sought to develop a psychometrically-sound scale to assess the entire range of dimensions on which autobiographical memories differ. We reviewed the literature on memory experiences and identified 10 relevant dimensions: Vividness, Coherence, Accessibility, Time Perspective, Sensory Details, Visual Perspective, Emotional Intensity, Sharing, Distancing, and Valence. We constructed a comprehensive item pool to assess these dimensions and, using data from several large samples ( Ns = 941; 510; 212), we showed that: (a) all 10 scales had adequate reliability (median alpha = .87; range = .72 to .97), (b) the 10-factor structure provided a good fit to the data, and (c) gender, personality, and memory recency had theoretically meaningful relations with the 10 scales. For example, gender and ethnicity differences in phenomenology were mediated by memory content, and early and recent memories had distinct phenomenologies. The discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical utility of the 10 scales.

In this example of one-trial event or episodic memory, an association must be formed between an object and a place ""out there,"" and the place can be recalled with the object as a recall cue, or the object can be recalled with the place as a recall cue. Hippocampal spatial view neurons in primates provide allocentric representations of a view of space ""out there."" The responses depend on where the monkey is looking; and can be updated by idiothetic (self-motion) inputs provided by eye movements when the view is hidden. In a room-based object-place memory task, some hippocampal neurons respond to the objects shown, some to the places viewed, and some to combinations of the places viewed and the objects present in those locations. In an object-place recall task when the location in space at which an object has been seen is recalled by the presentation of the object, some primate hippocampal neurons maintain their responding to the object recall cue in a delay period without the object being visible while the place is being recalled; and other neurons respond to the place being recalled. Other spatial view neurons form associations with the rewards present at particular locations in space.

The question of the neuroanatomical and neurobiological foundations of spatial behaviors has generated a huge amount of work in the last 40 years. In rodents, lesion and electrophysiological studies have identified the hippocampus as a key structure in the processing of spatial information. There is overwhelming evidence that the hippocampus is crucial for accurate performance in spatial tasks. Lesion studies have shown that the hippocampus does not mediate all strategies. Hippocampus-dependent strategies are thought to involve an allocentric spatial map (cognitive map), as in the Morris water-maze place navigation task, and are altered following hippocampal damage. In the early 1970's, the seminal discovery of spatially selective place cells in the CA3 and CAl hippocampal fields in freely moving rats led to the proposal that the hippocampus is the neural substrate of an allocentric spatial map. To understand the role of place cells, at least two fundamental questions need to be addressed. First, what are the determinants of location-specific firing, and second, how do place cells contribute to spatial behaviors? The issue of sensory and cognitive (mnemonic) determinants of spatial firing has been tackled in numerous studies. In particular, it has been shown that place cell activity is controlled by a variety of information including external (allothetic: visual, olfactory, etc.) and internal (idiothetic: vestibular, proprioceptive, etc.) information. Other work has proposed that the function of place cells is to encode sequences of multidimensional events that form episodic memory. In contrast, the second question has received little attention, and it remains unclear whether place cells control the animal's spatial behavior. Thus, the aim in the present chapter is to review relevant data on the relationships between place cell firing and animals' spatial behavior. Overall, although relatively few experiments have addressed this issue, most support the idea that hippocampal place cell activity is tightly coupled to spatial behavior and may encode various aspects of goal-directed behavior.

Whereas there is ample evidence for the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory, there has been controversy over the neural basis for navigation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the functions of place cells extend well beyond a specific role in mapping the physical space. Place cells have been shown to respond to salient nonspatial information and to make multiple representations of the same location. These and other observations suggest that the hippocampus associates spatial and nonspatial features of an environment or event into episodic memories, possibly leaving spatial computations to adjacent structures. One synapse upstream of the hippocampus, information about position, direction, speed, and self-motion converges in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Accordingly, principal neurons in this area express metric, positional, and directional information, activity suggesting that MEC plays a key role in navigation and spatial processing. In this chapter, the authors review current knowledge about spatial representations in MEC, its possible role in navigation, and how cell ensembles in MEC might contribute to the spatial component of hippocampal place cell representations.

Patients with temporal lobe damage extending to the HF could not remember locations of landmarks in space or specific spatial relationships among the landmarks, and had deficits in a radial-arm maze task. Consistent with these findings, studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of normal humans demonstrated that blood flow in the HF increased during various types of spatial tasks in a real or realistic virtual environment. Neurophysiological studies in rats support the human data. The relationship between spatial functions and episodic memory in the HF is one of the main issues. Changes in place-related activity (remapping) is suggested to be a neural basis of episodic memory. Basic spatial tuning of place cells is essentially formed by local geometrical intramaze and idiothetic cues. Other factors modulate this spatial tuning, including extramaze distal cues, which might set the orientation of the place fields of place cells or work as contexts to gate local geometrical and idiothetic cues. Another factor is cognitive requirement or task paradigms, which are reported to influence activity of place cells even in the same spatial environment. Thus, rodent studies suggest that remapping of place fields might be induced by both cognitive (or nonspatial) factors such as task requirements and changes in extramaze distal cues. In this chapter, the authors review their studies in which monkey HF neurons were analyzed during performance of either different tasks in the same spatial environment or essentially the same task in different spatial environments.

These concepts are applied to an implementation of a scenario where agents are interacting in a complex virtual artificial life environment. We present computational memory architectures for autobiographic virtual agents that enable agents to retrieve meaningful information from their dynamic memories which increases their adaptation and survival in the environment. The design of the memory architectures, the agents, and the virtual environment are described in detail. Next, a series of experimental studies and their results are presented which show the adaptive advantage of autobiographic memory, i.e. from remembering significant experiences. Also, in a multi-agent scenario where agents can communicate via stories based on their autobiographic memory, it is found that new adaptive behaviours can emerge from an individual's reinterpretation of experiences received from other agents whereby higher communication frequency yields better group performance. An interface is described that visualises the memory contents of an agent. From an observer perspective, the agents' behaviours can be understood as individually structured, and temporally grounded, and, with the communication of experience, can be seen to rely on emergent mixed narrative reconstructions combining the experiences of several agents. This research leads to insights into how bottom-up story-telling and autobiographic reconstruction in autonomous, adaptive agents allow temporally grounded behaviour to emerge. The article concludes with a discussion of possible implications of this research direction for future autobiographic, narrative agents.

Results indicated that shifting participants from a field to an observer perspective resulted in decreased experiential ratings: specifically, reduced distress and vividness. Also, as anticipated, the converse shift in perspective (from observer to field) did not lead to a corresponding increase in experiential ratings, but did result in reduced ratings of observation and a trend was observed for decreased levels of detachment. The findings support the notion that recall perspective has a functional role in the regulation of intrusion-related distress and represents a cognitive avoidance mechanism.

A growing body of research suggests that the visual perspective from which a memory is retrieved has important implications for a person's thoughts, feelings, and goals, and is integrally related to a host of self-evaluative processes.

Results from the two studies presented here provide further evidence of this common neural network. Previous evidence also suggests that recalling autobiographical memories from a first person or from a third person perspective can influence the way in which those memories are experienced as well as the brain regions that are engaged; however, the effect of perspective on imagining autobiographical events remains unclear. Results from Study 1 indicated that brain regions implicated in both remembering and imagining were differentially engaged during these tasks depending on whether a first person or a third person perspective was taken. In addition, while recalling autobiographical memories from a third person perspective can result in the feeling that a past self is more like another person, imagining oneself in the position of another person can result in the feeling that that person is more similar to oneself; this suggests a possible link between perspective in memory and social perspective taking. In Study 2, we identified several brain regions exhibiting a pattern of increasing or decreasing activation as a function of whether socially interactive events were recalled from a first person perspective, by imagining oneself as oneâ€™s partner, or from a third person perspective (i.e., as a function of distance from oneâ€™s own perspective). Together, our findings suggest that perspective plays an important role in the way in which brain regions that are part of this common neural network are engaged during memory, imagination, and socially interactive tasks.","2009","2018-06-18 10:52:01","2018-06-18 12:33:20",NA,"",135,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"The University of Arizona","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","304827282",NA,NA,"3373436",NA,"; ; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Effects+of+perspective+taking+on+memory+for+self+and+other&issn=&date=2009-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Cox%2C+Christine+Louise&isbn=9781109397222&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Effects+of+perspective+taking+on+memory+for+self+and+other&issn=&date=2010-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Cox%2C+Christine+Louise&isbn=978-1-109-39722-2&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2010-99060-128&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/304827282?accountid=14182; https://search.proquest.com/docview/622198315?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Effects+of+perspective+taking+on+memory+for+self+and+other&issn=&date=2009-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Cox%2C+Christine+Louise&isbn=9781109397222&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Effects+of+perspective+taking+on+memory+for+self+and+other&issn=&date=2010-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Cox%2C+Christine+Louise&isbn=978-1-109-39722-2&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2010-99060-128&rft_id=info:doi/","memory; Recall (Learning); Imagination; Human; recall; fMRI; Memory; Precuneus; Psychology; Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; autobiographical memories; 2300:Human Experimental Psychology; Brain; brain; 0623:Experimental psychology; 0633:Cognitive psychology; Cognitive psychology; Experimental psychology; Medial prefrontal cortex; Point of view; Theory of mind; neuroimaging; Neuroimaging; perspective taking; Biological Neural Networks; neural network",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The sequential egocentric strategy differs from a succession of independent simple egocentric responses as it requires a sequential ordering of events, possibly sharing functional similarity with episodic memory in this regard. To question the possible simultaneous encoding of sequential egocentric and allocentric strategies, we developed a paradigm in which these two strategies are spontaneously used or imposed. Our results evidenced that sequential egocentric strategy can be spontaneously acquired at the onset of the training as well as allocentric strategy. Allocentric and sequential egocentric strategies could be used together within a trial, and bidirectional shifts (between trials) were spontaneously performed during the training period by 30% of the participants. Regardless of the strategy used spontaneously during the training, all participants could execute immediate shifts to the opposite non previously used strategy when this strategy was imposed. Altogether, our findings suggest that subjects acquire different types of spatial knowledge in parallel, namely knowledge permitting allocentric navigation as well as knowledge permitting sequential egocentric navigation.

Multiple sources of evidence from fMRI and PET investigations suggest a central role for the precuneus in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval, and self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. Furthermore, the precuneus and surrounding structures within the posteromedial parietal region are thought to represent a crucial node in the 'default mode' system, a network of brain structures displaying high resting metabolic rate and transient deactivations during engagement in non self-referential tasks. Therefore, it has recently been proposed that the precuneus plays a pivotal role in the neural correlates of consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of pathophysiological states characterised by altered consciousness, such as sleep, vegetative state, and pharmacological anaesthesia. Functional neuroimaging studies on neuropsychiatric populations showing disruption of the 'default mode' activity have recently added novel insights into the understanding of the behavioural correlates of the precuneus.

Learning and recalling information from personal experiences (episodic) is central for everyday living; damage to the MTL results in an inability to learn new episodic information. This dissertation presents data from four experiments investigating the role of medial temporal structures during the learning and recall of episodic information. Using high-resolution functional MRI, we show that blood-oxygenated-level-dependent (BOLD) activity increases within the CA3 and dentate gyrus regions during encoding of novel associated contextual information of an episode and increases within the subiculum during retrieval of this learned information. Hippocampal CA1 activity increases and correlates to performance during learning of allocentric (viewpoint-independent) spatial information. Single neurons within the CA3 and dentate gyms differentiate in firing rate to similar episodes stored in memory. Additionally, these regions show BOLD decreases during episodic learning in older individuals who are genetically at-risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Overall, this dissertation supports the idea that separate hippocampal subregions contribute differently during the learning and recall of episodic information.

They measured cerebral activity, using fMRI, while CFS patients and healthy control subjects had to imagine fatigue-provoking events. The authors observed larger activity in the medial parietal cortex and precuneus in CFS patients during the fatigue-provocation task. Recent functional imaging findings in healthy subjects suggest a role for this area in imagery, episodic memory retrieval and self-processing operations like first-person perspective taking and experience of agency.

One of these strategies uses the action-based memory (egocentric) of the traveled route or paths, which involves kinesthetic memory, optic flow, and episodic memory, whereas the other strategy privileges a survey memory of cartographic type (allocentric). Most studies have dealt with these two strategies separately, but none has tried to show the interaction between them in spite of the fact that we commonly use a map to imagine our journey and then proceed using egocentric navigation. An interesting question is therefore: how does prior allocentric knowledge of the environment affect the egocentric, purely kinesthetic navigation processes involved in human navigation? We designed an experiment in which blindfolded subjects had first to walk and memorize a path with kinesthetic cues only. They had previously been shown a map of the path, which was either correct or distorted (consistent shrinking or growing). The latter transformations were studied in order to observe what influence a distorted prior knowledge could have on spatial mechanisms. After having completed the first learning travel along the path, they had to perform several spatial tasks during the testing phase: (1) pointing towards the origin and (2) to specific points encountered along the path, (3) a free locomotor reproduction, and (4) a drawing of the memorized path. The results showed that prior cartographic knowledge influences the paths drawn and the spatial inference capacity, whereas neither locomotor reproduction nor spatial updating was disturbed. Our results strongly support the notion that (1) there are two independent neural bases underlying these mechanisms: a map-like representation allowing allocentric spatial inferences, and a kinesthetic memory of self-motion in space; and (2) a common use of, or a switching between, these two strategies is possible. Nevertheless, allocentric representations can emerge from the experience of kinesthetic cues alone.

Structural learning refers to the ability to learn the precise combination of stimulus identity with stimulus location. Rats with anterior thalamic lesions and fornix lesions were unimpaired on a configural learning task in which the rats learned 3 concurrent mirror-image discriminations (structural learning). Indeed, both lesions led to facilitated learning. In contrast, anterior thalamic lesions impaired the geometric discrimination (e.g., swim to the corner with the short wall to the right of the long wall). Finally, both the fornix and anterior thalamic lesions severely impaired T-maze alternation, a task that taxes an array of spatial strategies including allocentric learning. This pattern of dissociations and double dissociations highlights how distinct classes of spatial learning rely on different systems, even though they may converge on the hippocampus. Consequently, the findings suggest that structural learning is heavily dependent on cortico-hippocampal interactions. In contrast, subcortical inputs (such as those from the anterior thalamus) contribute to geometric learning.

In the present study, long-term recall of spatial arrays following incidental learning (text messaging or calculator use) was tested under three different motor conditions at retrieval. For both letter and number arrays, the accuracy of recall was found to be improved by relevant enactment at the time of retrieval, relative to retrieval with no movement. In contrast, irrelevant movement was found to produce an impairment in accuracy. The overall accuracy of recalling a letter array was found to be a power-law function of the frequency of exposure to the array. The findings are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that appropriate movement during memory retrieval recruits egocentric representations that supplement allocentric representations subserving longer term spatial recall.

Motivational states specify goals, and memory can inform motivated behavior by providing detailed records of past experiences when goals were obtained. These 2 fundamental processes interact to guide animals to biologically relevant targets, but the neuronal mechanisms that integrate them remain unknown. To investigate these mechanisms, we recorded unit activity from the same population of hippocampal neurons as rats performed identical tasks while either food or water deprived. We compared the influence of motivational state (hunger and thirst), memory demand, and spatial behavior in 2 tasks: hippocampus-dependent contextual memory retrieval and hippocampus- independent random foraging. We found that: (i) hippocampal coding was most strongly influenced by motivational state during contextual memory retrieval, when motivational cues were required to select among remembered, goal-directed actions in the same places; (ii) the same neuronal populations were relatively unaffected by motivational state during random foraging, when hunger and thirst were incidental to behavior, and signals derived from deprivation states thus informed, but did not determine, hippocampal coding; and (iii) â€˜â€˜prospective codingâ€™â€™ in the contextual retrieval task was not influenced by allocentric spatial trajectory, but rather by the animalâ€™s deprivation state and the associated, nonspatial target, suggesting that hippocampal coding includes a wide range of predictive associations. The results show that beyond coding spatiotemporal context, hippocampal representations encode the relationships between internal states, the external environment, and action to provide a mechanism by which motivation and memory are coordinated to guide behavior.

Memories recalled from a first-person â€œfieldâ€ perspective are phenomenologically rich, while third-person â€œobserverâ€ perspective memories contain more descriptive but less affective detail (Nigro & Neisser, 1983). Although there is some evidence that depressed individuals retrieve more observer memories than non-depressed individuals (e.g., Kuyken & Howell, 2006), little is known of the cognitive mechanisms associated with observer memories in depression. At pre- and post-treatment, 123 patients with a history of recurrent depression completed self-report measures and the autobiographical memory task (AMT). Participants also indicated the vantage perspective of the memories recalled on the AMT. Observer memories were less vivid, older, and more frequently rehearsed. The tendency to retrieve observer perspective memories was associated with greater negative self-evaluation, lower dispositional mindfulness, and greater use of avoidance. Furthermore, participants who recalled more field perspective memories at pre-treatment had lower levels of post-treatment depression, controlling for pre-treatment levels of depression and trait rumination. We apply contemporary accounts from social and cognitive psychology, and propose potential mechanisms that link the tendency to retrieve observer perspective memories to depression.

We combined fMRI, event narratives, and subjective ratings to identify the neural networks engaged with field versus observer memories for real-world events. Our results revealed significant decreases in bilateral insula and left somato-motor activity during the recall of observer memories, paired with a small relative increase in right posterior amygdala activity coincident with the recall of field memories. Notably, these regions showed no overlap with those areas mediating the narrative content and subjective emotionality of the remembered events. Our findings suggest that the emotionality of field relative to observer memories is not simply driven by increased limbic activation when one adopts a first-person retrieval perspective. Rather, there is also a significant reduction in one's cortical representations of the physical, embodied self when a third-personâ€”or disembodiedâ€”perspective is taken at retrieval.

This study aimed to examine visual perspective in healthy never-depressed subjects presenting with either genetic or psychological vulnerability for depression. Sixty healthy participants performed the Autobiographical Memory Test with an assessment of visual perspective. Genetic vulnerability was defined by the presence of at least one S or L G allele of the polymorphism of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR). Psychological vulnerability was defined by high scores of harm avoidance measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory. Life stress exposure, depressive mood, rumination, and familial history of depression were assessed through standardized procedures. Visual perspective for positive memories was independently predicted by both harm avoidance and a gene by environment interaction between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and life stress exposure.

However, the association of 3rd person perspective with vulnerability for depression does not rely only on genetics. External consistency is provided by the influence of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on brain regions involved in emotion regulation and autobiographical memory retrieval (e.g. the medial prefrontal cortex). Internal consistency is provided by the increased prevalence of 3rd person perspective in both currently and previously depressed patients, as well as in depression-prone individuals.

This relative anosognosia of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients for personality changes might be related to impaired self-judgment and to decreased ability to understand their caregiver's perspective. To investigate this issue, we explored the cerebral correlates of self-assessment and perspective taking in patients with mild AD, elderly and young volunteers. All subjects assessed relevance of personality traits adjectives for self and a relative, taking either their own or their relative's perspective, during a functional imaging experiment. The comparison of subject's and relative's answers provided congruency scores used to assess self-judgment and perspective taking performance. The self-judgment â€œaccuracyâ€ score was diminished in AD, and when patients assessed adjectives for self-relevance, they predominantly activated bilateral intraparietal sulci (IPS). Previous studies associated IPS activation with familiarity judgment, which AD patients would use more than recollection when retrieving information to assess self-personality. When taking a third-person perspective, patients activated prefrontal regions (similarly to young volunteers), while elderly controls recruited visual associative areas (also activated by young volunteers). This suggests that mild AD patients relied more on reasoning processes than on visual imagery of autobiographical memories to take their relative's perspective. This strategy may help AD patients to cope with episodic memory impairment even if it does not prevent them from making some mind-reading errors.

(1978). The hippocampus as a cognitive map. London: Oxford University Press]. However, although several types of spatial relations exist, such as allocentric (i.e. object-to-object relations), egocentric (i.e. static object-to-self relations) or egocentric updated on navigation information (i.e. self-to-environment relations in a dynamic way), usually only allocentric representations are described as potentially subserving episodic memory [Nadel, L., & Moscovitch, M. (1998). Hippocampal contributions to cortical plasticity. Neuropharmacology, 37(4â€“5), 431â€“439]. This study proposes to confront the allocentric representation hypothesis with an egocentric updated with self-motion representation hypothesis. In the present study, we explored retrieval performance in relation to these two types of spatial processing levels during learning. Episodic remembering has been assessed through Remember responses in a recall and in a recognition task, combined with a â€œRemember-Know-Guessâ€ paradigm [Gardiner, J. M. (2001). Episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness: A first-person approach. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 356(1413), 1351â€“1361] to assess the autonoetic level of responses. Our results show that retrieval performance was significantly higher when encoding was performed in the egocentric-updated condition. Although egocentric updated with self-motion and allocentric representations are not mutually exclusive, these results suggest that egocentric updating processing facilitates remember responses more than allocentric processing. The results are discussed according to Burgess and colleaguesâ€™ model of episodic memory [Burgess, N., Becker, S., King, J. A., & Oâ€™Keefe, J. (2001).

Functional neuroimaging studies of AM are important because they can investigate the neural correlates of processes that are difficult to study using laboratory stimuli, including: complex constructive processes, subjective qualities of memory retrieval, and remote memory. Three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are presented to examine these important contributions of AM. The first study investigates the neural correlates of temporal-order memory for autobiographical events using a novel photo paradigm. Participants took photographs at many campus locations over a period of several hours, and the following day they were scanned while making temporal-order judgments to pairs of photographs from different locations. It was found that temporal-order decisions associated with recollection recruited left prefrontal (PFC) and left posterior parahippocampal cortex, whereas temporal-order decisions relying on familiarity recruited greater activity in the right PFC.   The second study examines self-projection, the capacity to re-experience the personal past and to mentally infer another person's perspective. A novel camera technology was used to examine self-projection by prospectively generating dynamic visuospatial images taken from a first-person perspective. Participants were literally asked to self-project into the personal past or into the life of another person. Self-projection of one's own past self recruited greater ventral medial PFC (mPFC), and self-projection of another individual recruited dorsal mPFC. Activity in ventral vs. dorsal mPFC was also sensitive to the ability to relive or understand the perspective taken on each trial. Further, task-related functional connectivity analysis revealed that ventral mPFC contributed to the medial temporal lobe network linked to memory processes, whereas dorsal mPFC contributed to the frontoparietal network linked to controlled processes.    The third study focuses on the neural correlates underlying age-related differences in the recall of episodically rich AMs. Age-related attenuation in the episodic richness of AM was linked to reductions in activity elicited during elaboration. Age effects on AM were more pronounced during elaboration than search, with older adults showing less sustained recruitment of the hippocampus and ventrolateral PFC for less episodically rich AMs. Further, there was an age-related reduction in the top-down modulation of the PFC on the hippocampus by episodic richness, possibly reflecting fewer controlled processes operating on the recovery of information in the hippocampus.   Ultimately, the goal of all memory research is to understand how memory operates in the real-world; the present research highlights the important contribution of functional neuroimaging studies of AM in attaining this goal.","2010","2018-06-18 10:52:39","2018-06-19 10:18:37",NA,"",179,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Duke University","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","231218379",NA,NA,"3398383",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Functional+neuroimaging+of+autobiographical+memory&issn=&date=2010-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=St.+Jacques%2C+Peggy+L.&isbn=9781109714081&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/231218379?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Functional+neuroimaging+of+autobiographical+memory&issn=&date=2010-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=St.+Jacques%2C+Peggy+L.&isbn=9781109714081&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Functional+neuroimaging+of+autobiographical+memory&issn=&date=2010-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=St.+Jacques%2C+Peggy+L.&isbn=978-1-109-71408-1&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2010-99200-113&rft_id=info:doi/","0317:Neurosciences; 0349:Psychobiology; 0633:Cognitive psychology; 2500:Physiological Psychology & Neuroscience; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Aged (65 yrs & older); Aging; autobiographical memory; Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Biological sciences; Cognitive psychology; Empirical Study; fMRI; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; functional neuroimaging; Functional neuroimaging; Human; Memory; Neuroimaging; Neurosciences; Psychobiology; Psychology; Recollection",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aMCI group was also stratified using cued recall according to Dubois' criteria into memory impairment of the hippocampal type (n = 10) and isolated memory retrieval impairment-nonhippocampal (n = 32) and also according to ApoE4 status into E4+ (n = 12) and E4- (n = 30). These patients and controls (n = 28) were tested in the human variant of the Morris water maze. Depending on the subtest, the subjects could use the egocentric or allocentric (hippocampus-dependent) navigation.RESULTSThe AD and aMCI multiple domain groups were impaired in all subtests. The aMCI single domain group was impaired in allocentric subtests. The hippocampal MCI group performed poorer than the nonhippocampal MCI group and similarly to the AD group. The ApoE4+ group was as bad as the AD group when compared with the E4- group.CONCLUSIONaMCI subjects represent a very heterogeneous population, and spatial memory or cued recall examination can add more value to aMCI classification.

However, after more than 100 years of memory research, it remains far from fully understood. Furthermore, elements of the process of retrievalâ€”such as the difference between voluntary and involuntary recallâ€”remain a mystery. This volume expands the understanding of autobiographical remembering and draws attention to hitherto neglected areas of research. It offers a number of theoretical views, tackling key questions such as functionality, the problem of volition, and the larger role of consciousness. It covers the methodology used to study retrieval, pointing out advances, limitations, and future challenges in the field. Contributors discuss topics such as retrieval inhibition, the development of remembering in childhood, and intrusive memories in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder and depression. The Act of Remembering is the first volume devoted solely to autobiographical memory retrieval, and brings together contributions from leading researchers from around the world. It serves as a primer for the field, as well as a roadmap that will guide present and future researchers as they continue to solve the problem of remembering.

Although the hippocampus has been implicated in learning new allocentric spatial information, converging evidence suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) might support egocentric representations. To date, however, few studies have examined long-standing egocentric representations of environments learned long ago. Here we tested 7 patients with focal lesions in PPC and 12 normal controls in remote spatial memory tasks, including 2 tasks reportedly reliant on allocentric representations (distance and proximity judgments) and 2 tasks reportedly reliant on egocentric representations (landmark sequencing and route navigation; see Rosenbaum, Ziegler, Winocur, Grady, & Moscovitch, 2004). Patients were unimpaired in distance and proximity judgments. In contrast, they all failed in route navigation, and left-lesioned patients also showed marginally impaired performance in landmark sequencing. Patients' subjective experience associated with navigation was impoverished and disembodied compared with that of the controls. These results suggest that PPC is crucial for accessing remote spatial memories within an egocentric reference frame that enables both navigation and reexperiencing. Additionally, PPC was found to be necessary to implement specific aspects of allocentric navigation with high demands on spontaneous retrieval.

This study employed a multiple-systems framework derived from the rodent literature to investigate visualâ€“spatial memory abilities associated with schizophrenia. Method: Using the bin task, a human analog of rodent maze tasks, everyday objects were hidden in visually identical bins. Following a 1-min filled delay, participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders ( n = 30) and healthy community controls ( n = 30) were asked to identify both the object hidden and bin used on the basis of its spatial location. Three dimensions of visualâ€“spatial memory were contrasted: (a) memory for spatial locations versus memory for objects, (b) allocentric (viewpoint independent) versus egocentric (body-centered) spatial representations, and (c) event (working) memory versus reference memory. Results: Most pronounced was a differential deficit in memory for spatial locations under allocentric ( p = .005, d = âˆ’0.77) but not egocentric viewing conditions ( p = .298, d = âˆ’0.28) in the schizophrenia group relative to healthy controls. Similarly, schizophrenia-related spatial memory deficits were pronounced under demands for event memory ( p = .004, d = âˆ’0.77) but not reference memory ( p = .171, d = âˆ’0.33). Conclusions: These results support a heuristic of preferential deficits in hippocampal-mediated forms of memory in schizophrenia. Moreover, the task provides a useful paradigm for translational research and the pattern of deficits suggests that persons with schizophrenia may benefit from mnemonic approaches favoring egocentric representations and consistency when interacting with our visualâ€“spatial world.

These hippocampal neurons respond selectively to the context of specific episodes despite interference from overlapping memory representations. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to examine the role of the hippocampus and related structures when participants need to retrieve contextual information to navigate well learned spatial sequences that share common elements. Participants were trained outside the scanner to navigate through 12 virtual mazes from a ground-level first-person perspective. Six of the 12 mazes shared overlapping components. Overlapping mazes began and ended at distinct locations, but converged in the middle to share some hallways with another maze. Non-overlapping mazes did not share any hallways with any other maze. Successful navigation through the overlapping hallways required the retrieval of contextual information relevant to the current navigational episode. Results revealed greater activation during the successful navigation of the overlapping mazes compared with the non-overlapping mazes in regions typically associated with spatial and episodic memory, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. When combined with previous research, the current findings suggest that an anatomically integrated system including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex is critical for the contextually dependent retrieval of well learned overlapping navigational routes.","2010-05-26","2018-06-18 10:52:59","2018-06-18 12:29:25",NA,"7414-7422",NA,"21","30",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","733090544; 20505108",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Which+way+was+I+going%3F+Contextual+retrieval+supports+the+disambiguation+of+well+learned+overlapping+navigational+routes.&title=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&issn=1529-2401&date=2010-05-26&volume=30&issue=21&spage=7414&au=Brown%2C+Thackery+I%3BRoss%2C+Robert+S%3BKeller%2C+Joseph+B%3BHasselmo%2C+Michael+E%3BStern%2C+Chantal+E&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/20505108&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.6021-09.2010; http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/30/21/7414.full.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/733090544?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Which+way+was+I+going%3F+Contextual+retrieval+supports+the+disambiguation+of+well+learned+overlapping+navigational+routes.&title=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&issn=1529-2401&date=2010-05-26&volume=30&issue=21&spage=7414&au=Brown%2C+Thackery+I%3BRoss%2C+Robert+S%3BKeller%2C+Joseph+B%3BHasselmo%2C+Michael+E%3BStern%2C+Chantal+E&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/20505108&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.6021-09.2010; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Which+way+was+I+going%3F+Contextual+retrieval+supports+the+disambiguation+of+well+learned+overlapping+navigational+routes&title=The+Journal+of+Neuroscience&issn=02706474&date=2010-05-26&volume=30&issue=21&spage=7414&au=Brown%2C+Thackery+I.%3BRoss%2C+Robert+S.%3BKeller%2C+Joseph+B.%3BHasselmo%2C+Michael+E.%3BStern%2C+Chantal+E.&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2010-10812-027&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.6021-09.2010","Adult; Humans; Male; memory; Cues; Human; Hippocampus; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Photic Stimulation; Young Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Mental Recall; Index Medicus; Spatial Behavior -- physiology; Brain Mapping; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Maze Learning; Spatial Behavior; Spatial Memory; Neurons; Maze Learning -- physiology; User-Computer Interface; US; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Recall -- physiology; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; Magnetic Resonance Imaging -- methods; Photic Stimulation -- methods; Brain; Brain -- physiology; hippocampus; Reaction Time; Reaction Time -- physiology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Oxygen; Brain -- blood supply; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted -- methods; Oxygen -- blood; S88TT14065; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Feedback, Sensory -- physiology; Brain Imaging; Contextual Associations; contextual retrieval; Feedback, Sensory; navigational trajectories; neurons; spatial disambiguation; Mental Recall/*physiology; Oxygen/blood; *Brain Mapping; *Cues; Photic Stimulation/methods; Spatial Behavior/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Reaction Time/physiology; Brain/blood supply/*physiology; Feedback, Sensory/physiology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Maze Learning/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Information encoded by the autoassociation network of cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) situates landmarks and objects within an allocentric framework of space and time. Guiding locomotion across the spatial environment, and generally organizing behaviour that transcends space and time, the hippocampus creates phenomenal space and time themselves, thus laying the foundations for conscious awareness. It is argued that conscious experience describes/symbolizes the informational content of self-organizing activity patterns in CA3. Imagery, conscious perception or hallucinations do not in themselves affect the physical trajectory of behaviour but are evidence for patterns of neuronal activity that, acting via the medial prefrontal cortex, modulate action dispositions and influence prefrontal top-down attentional control of sensory processing and thus subsequent event memory formation. Evidence for GABAergic deficit and pyramidal cell hyperexcitability in CA3 in patients with schizophrenia is consistent with the notion that binding, by the CA3 network, of cortical modules representing weakly related sensory representations underlies hallucinations in this disorder.

In addition, we assessed characteristics of memory for the event, including visual perspective and the centrality of the memory to the participant's autobiographical narrative (CES). Shame predicted depression and PTSD symptoms. There was no association between guilt and psychological symptoms after controlling statistically for the effects of shame. CES predicted the severity of depression and PTSD symptoms. In addition, CES mediated the moderating effect of visual perspective on the relationship between emotional intensity and PTSD symptoms. Our results suggest shame is capable of eliciting the intrusive and distressing memories characteristic of PTSD.

Its early decline is symptomatic for elderly dementia. Substances that selectively reduce alpha5-GABA(A) receptor function are currently developed as potential cognition enhancers for Alzheimer's syndrome and other dementia, consistent with genetic studies implicating these receptors that are highly expressed in hippocampus in learning performance. Here we explored the consequences of reduced GABA(A)alpha5-subunit contents, as occurring in alpha5(H105R) knock-in mice, on the memory for location of objects. This required the behavioral characterization of alpha5(H105R) and wild-type animals in various tasks examining learning and memory retrieval strategies for objects, locations, contexts and their combinations. In mutants, decreased amounts of alpha5-subunits and retained long-term potentiation in hippocampus were confirmed. They exhibited hyperactivity with conserved circadian rhythm in familiar actimeters, and normal exploration and emotional reactivity in novel places, allocentric spatial guidance, and motor pattern learning acquisition, inhibition and flexibility in T- and eight-arm mazes.

Its early decline is symptomatic for elderly dementia. Substances that selectively reduce Î±5-GABA A receptor function are currently developed as potential cognition enhancers for Alzheimer's syndrome and other dementia, consistent with genetic studies implicating these receptors that are highly expressed in hippocampus in learning performance. Here we explored the consequences of reduced GABA AÎ±5-subunit contents, as occurring in Î±5(H105R) knock-in mice, on the memory for location of objects. This required the behavioral characterization of Î±5(H105R) and wild-type animals in various tasks examining learning and memory retrieval strategies for objects, locations, contexts and their combinations. In mutants, decreased amounts of Î±5-subunits and retained long-term potentiation in hippocampus were confirmed. They exhibited hyperactivity with conserved circadian rhythm in familiar actimeters, and normal exploration and emotional reactivity in novel places, allocentric spatial guidance, and motor pattern learning acquisition, inhibition and flexibility in T- and eight-arm mazes. Processing of object, position and context memories and object-guided response learning were spared. Genotype difference in object-in-place memory retrieval and in encoding and response learning strategies for objectâ€“location combinations manifested as a bias favoring object-based recognition and guidance strategies over spatial processing of objects in the mutants. These findings identify in Î±5(H105R) mice a behavioralâ€“cognitive phenotype affecting basal locomotion and the memory for location of objects indicative of hippocampal dysfunction resulting from moderately decreased Î±5-subunit contents.

Both representations can be identified in hippocampal activity before their effect on behavior at subsequent choice-points. Our results suggest that, rather than providing a single common function, the two hippocampi provide complementary representations for navigation, concerning places on the right and temporal sequences on the left, both of which likely contribute to different aspects of episodic memory.","2010-08-10","2018-06-18 10:53:15","2018-06-18 12:37:46",NA,"14466-14471",NA,"32","107",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","748937466; 20660746",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Lateralized+human+hippocampal+activity+predicts+navigation+based+on+sequence+or+place+memory.&title=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&issn=1091-6490&date=2010-08-10&volume=107&issue=32&spage=14466&au=Igl%C3%B3i%2C+Kinga%3BDoeller%2C+Christian+F%3BBerthoz%2C+Alain%3BRondi-Reig%2C+Laure%3BBurgess%2C+Neil&isbn=&jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/20660746&rft_id=info:doi/10.1073%2Fpnas.1004243107; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Lateralized+human+hippocampal+activity+predicts+navigation+based+on+sequence+or+place+memory&title=PNAS+Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&issn=00278424&date=2010-08-10&volume=107&issue=32&spage=14466&au=Igl%C3%B3i%2C+Kinga%3BDoeller%2C+Christian+F.%3BBerthoz%2C+Alain%3BRondi-Reig%2C+Laure%3BBurgess%2C+Neil&isbn=&jtitle=PNAS+Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2010-16827-008&rft_id=info:doi/10.1073%2Fpnas.1004243107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922562/pdf/pnas.201004243.pdf","Humans; Male; Spatial Perception; Human; Episodic Memory; Hippocampus; episodic memory; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Mental Recall; Index Medicus; Hippocampus -- physiology; Brain Mapping; Space Perception; 2530:Electrophysiology; Electrical Activity; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Functional Laterality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Recall -- physiology; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; Time Perception; 2300:Human Experimental Psychology; Functional Laterality -- physiology; hippocampus; Brain Imaging; brain activation; lateralized human hippocampal activity; spatial navigation; Hippocampus/*physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Functional Laterality/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although previous research has established that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have diminished episodic memory, episodic future thinking has not previously been investigated within this population. In the present study, high-functioning adults with ASD were compared to closely matched typical adults on a task requiring participants to report a series of events that happened to them in the past and a series of events that might happen to them in the future. For each event described, participants completed two modified Memory Characteristics Questionnaire items to assess self-reported phenomenal qualities associated with remembering and imagining, including self-perspective and degree of autonoetic awareness. Participants also completed letter, category, and ideational fluency tasks. Results indicated that participants with ASD recalled/imagined significantly fewer specific events than did comparison participants and that participants with ASD demonstrated impaired episodic memory and episodic future thinking. In line with this finding, participants with ASD were less likely than comparison participants to report taking a field (first-person) perspective and were more likely to report taking an observer (third-person) perspective during retrieval of past events (but not during simulation of future events), highlighting that they were less likely to mentally reexperience past events from their own point of view. There were no group differences in self-reported levels of autonoetic awareness or fluency task performance.

Closure is a subjective assessment of how far a remembered experience feels resolved, and it has been suggested that one predictor of closure is the amount of emotional detail in the memory. Study 1 examined which aspect of emotional detail is important for closure, and showed that open and closed negative memories were distinguished by ratings of emotion evoked during recall, not by remembered emotion from the time of the event. The recall of open memories was accompanied by more intense, more negative, and less positive emotion than the recall of closed memories. Biased retelling of memories has been shown to influence closure and on the basis of evidence that third-person recall serves a distancing function, Study 2 examined whether instructions to repeatedly recount an open memory from a third-person perspective would increase closure compared with a single or repeated recounting from a first-person perspective. While repeated third-person recounting had the greatest influence on closure, there were also increases in the first-person recounting groups. The results suggest that closure can be increased by reporting memories in written narrative form, particularly if repeatedly expressed from the third-person perspective.","2010-11","2018-06-18 10:53:23","2018-06-18 12:33:23",NA,"900-917",NA,"8","18",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","814463532; 21108108",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Closure+of+autobiographical+memories%3A+The+effects+of+written+recounting+from+first-+or+third-person+visual+perspective.&title=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&issn=1464-0686&date=2010-11-01&volume=18&issue=8&spage=900&au=Crawley%2C+Ros+A&isbn=&jtitle=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/21108108&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09658211.2010.524650; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211.2010.524650?needAccess=true; https://search.proquest.com/docview/814463532?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Closure+of+autobiographical+memories%3A+The+effects+of+written+recounting+from+first-+or+third-person+visual+perspective.&title=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&issn=1464-0686&date=2010-11-01&volume=18&issue=8&spage=900&au=Crawley%2C+Ros+A&isbn=&jtitle=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/21108108&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09658211.2010.524650; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Closure+of+autobiographical+memories%3A+The+effects+of+written+recounting+from+first-+or+third-person+visual+perspective&title=Memory&issn=09658211&date=2010-11-01&volume=18&issue=8&spage=900&au=Crawley%2C+Ros+A.&isbn=&jtitle=Memory&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2010-24849-009&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09658211.2010.524650","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Human; visual perspective; Adolescent; Female; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Emotional Content; Empirical Study; 2343:Learning & Memory; Autobiographical Memory; Mental Recall; Index Medicus; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); autobiographical memories; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Visual Perception; Quantitative Study; United Kingdom; Perceptual Closure; Writing; emotional detail; Written Communication; written recounting; *Mental Recall; *Visual Perception; *Perceptual Closure",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Human data regarding the roles of the various subregional networks within the hippocampus is difficult to obtain. In this article we examine the current rodent literature on episodic-like memory and associative recognition and review the roles of the hippocampal subregions in these behavioural tasks. We focus on the large amount of recent data reporting roles for CA3 and CA1 in allocentric spatial and temporal associative memory respectively. Our own recent data are then presented detailing critical roles for CA3 and CA1 in an associative recognition task which does not require allocentric spatial or temporal processing. These data support more generic roles for CA3 and CA1 in episodic-like memory, based on anatomical and theoretical literature on hippocampal function. We also present a novel analysis of our data in which we suggest that the encoding of object, place and context information is unaffected by lesions of the hippocampus and therefore infer that it may be the storage or retrieval phase of this associative memory which is critically dependent on hippocampal function. In conclusion however, more specific anatomically and temporally controlled methods are needed to fully define the role of hippocampal subregions in episodic-like memory.

The first part of this thesis focuses on episodic-like memory, defined by the original episodic memory triad: â€˜what-where-whenâ€™ (Tulving 1972), which enables the behavioural aspects of episodic memory to be tested in non-human animals. Permanent neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus and itâ€™s subregions were induced to assess their role in a putative episodic-like memory task developed by Eacott and Norman (2004). In view of the difficulties encountered in successfully demonstrating the temporal component of episodic-like memory in rats, this task tested integrated memory for â€˜what-where-whichâ€™, where the temporal component (when) was replaced with another event specifier: context (on â€˜whichâ€™ occasion). Disruption of the hippocampal circuitry led to a specific impairment in the integration of all three event components, whereas the associative recognition of any combination of these features in isolation was left intact. These results confirm the hippocampal dependence of this episodic-like memory task and further reveals the necessity of both CA3 and CA1, hypothetically due to the underlying autoassociative role of CA3 with CA1 functioning as the vital output pathway for this associated information and/or as a mismatch detector. There has been much debate over the inclusion of the temporal component and sceptics may argue that any such interpretations of task-dependence on episodic-like memory processing are invalid considering the requirement for temporal processing is absent. Due to the proposal that a temporal framework necessarily provides the foundation on which episodic memories are built, the second chapter focuses on the development of a suitable protocol in which integrated memory for the original â€˜what-where-whenâ€™ episodic memory triad can be reliably tested. The other main function attributed to the hippocampus was brought to light by the fascinating revelation that itâ€™s neurons selectively fire in different regions of an environment, termed â€˜place cellsâ€™ (Oâ€™Keefe and Dostrovsky 1971). From the numerous publications resulting from this discovery it has emerged that place cells not only respond to the spatial features of the environment but are also sensitive to a multitude of non-spatial features. These characteristics support the logical assumption that the primary firing patterns of the hippocampus should underlie itâ€™s main purported roles, leading to speculations that they reflect episodic memory processes. The second part of this thesis aims to examine the relationship between hippocampal cells and behaviour by extending the work of Ainge et al. (2007a), in which a subset of hippocampal place cells were found to encode both current and intended destination in a double Y-maze â€˜win-stayâ€™ task. The development of these â€˜goal-sensitiveâ€™ cells were initially investigated during the learning phase of this task. An exciting pattern of results showed a strong positive correlation between the emergence of goal-sensitive firing and behavioural performance on the task, tempting speculations that these firing patterns may underlie spatial learning and future planning, necessary to support performance. To ensure these firing patterns were not a mere reflection of greater experience on the maze, a second study was conducted in which the task demands changed over set periods of days. A significant increase in the proportion of cells demonstrating goal-sensitive firing was revealed when the protocol shifted to incorporate the spatial memory demands of the â€˜win-stayâ€™ task, with all other parameters of the protocol remaining constant. These results support the theory that goal-sensitive firing patterns are specifically related to the learning and memory demands of the spatial task, not a result of increased exploration of the maze. The last of this series of studies assessed hippocampal-dependence of this task and revealed that bilateral hippocampal lesions induced an impairment in spatial â€˜win-stayâ€™ performance. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that goal-sensitive firing of hippocampal cells emerge in line with behavioural performance in a hippocampal-dependent task and the emergence of these firing patterns are specific to the learning and memory demands of a spatial â€˜win-stayâ€™ protocol. The functional role of the hippocampus in allocentric spatial processing may thus underpin itâ€™s function in episodic memory and potentially in the imagining and planning of future events, whereby the hippocampus provides a â€˜spaceâ€™ in which retrieved information can be integrated in a coherent context to support the fluent and flexible use of information. This hippocampal function would necessarily require visual information to be accessed, concerning the arrangement of landmarks and cues within the environment, in association with information regarding internal orientation and direction and this leads to the question assessed in the final part of this thesis of where this integration occurs. Based on anatomical evidence and the current literature, the postsubiculum, an input structure to the hippocampus, emerged as a potential site for the convergence of sensory cues into the internally generated head direction cell and place cell networks to enable hippocampal-dependent spatial processing. Thus, the effects of temporary pharmacological blockade of AMPARs and NMDARs in the postsubiculum were assessed on the encoding of spatial memory in an object recognition paradigm. The impairment revealed in the ability to recognise novel object-place configurations demonstrates a key role for NMDAR-dependent plasticity within the postsubiculum itself in the formation of allocentric spatial memory. In summary, the experimental results reported in this thesis further elucidate the critical role the hippocampal formation plays in spatial and episodic memory by combining evidence from cellular physiology and neuroanatomy to the behaving animal and extends these findings to discuss a more general role for the hippocampus in imagining both past and future events, in order to successfully navigate, learn and enable past experience to influence our intended future plans and decisions.","2011","2018-06-18 10:53:30","2018-06-19 10:18:44",NA,"",1,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"The University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1124332105",NA,NA,"U575742",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Investigating+the+role+of+the+hippocampal+formation+in+episodic+and+spatial+memory&issn=&date=2011-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Stevenson%2C+Cassie+Hayley&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1124332105?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Investigating+the+role+of+the+hippocampal+formation+in+episodic+and+spatial+memory&issn=&date=2011-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Stevenson%2C+Cassie+Hayley&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","(UMI)AAIU575742; 0317:Neurosciences; Biological sciences; http://hdl.handle.net/1842/5632; Neurosciences; Psychology--Abstracting, Bibliographies, Statistics",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To further understand the unravelling of the recollective experience in pathological ageing, we investigated autobiographical memory (ABM) using the Episodic Autobiographical Memory Interview (EAMI) in thirty middle-aged and thirty healthy elderly controls, and twenty patients with mild AD. Of key interest was the recall of contextual details and the behavioural markers predictive of autonoetic reliving. AD patients exhibited significant difficulties in recalling contextual details across all life epochs on the EAMI manifesting in a negative temporal gradient from the Early Adulthood epoch onwards. Overall there was a low incidence of autonoetic consciousness during ABM recall across all participant groups and life epochs when compared with previous studies. AD patients showed a compromised capacity to mentally relive past memories (AD<healthy elderly<middle-aged controls), across all life epochs on the EAMI. AD patients tended to recall past events as semanticised accounts divested of rich sensory-perceptual imagery. The impoverished capacity to generate egocentric or self-referential imagery resulted in the production of fragmented and depersonalised accounts of formerly evocative events and likely stems from medial temporal and frontal pathology exhibited from early stages of the disease.","2011-02","2018-06-18 10:53:32","2018-06-18 12:38:12",NA,"236-249",NA,"2","47",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","820785902; 20153463",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Impaired+capacity+for+autonoetic+reliving+during+autobiographical+event+recall+in+mild+Alzheimer%27s+disease.&title=Cortex%3B+a+journal+devoted+to+the+study+of+the+nervous+system+and+behavior&issn=1973-8102&date=2011-02-01&volume=47&issue=2&spage=236&au=Irish%2C+Muireann%3BLawlor%2C+Brian+A%3BO%27Mara%2C+Shane+M%3BCoen%2C+Robert+F&isbn=&jtitle=Cortex%3B+a+journal+devoted+to+the+study+of+the+nervous+system+and+behavior&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/20153463&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.cortex.2010.01.002; https://search.proquest.com/docview/820785902?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Impaired+capacity+for+autonoetic+reliving+during+autobiographical+event+recall+in+mild+Alzheimer%27s+disease.&title=Cortex%3B+a+journal+devoted+to+the+study+of+the+nervous+system+and+behavior&issn=1973-8102&date=2011-02-01&volume=47&issue=2&spage=236&au=Irish%2C+Muireann%3BLawlor%2C+Brian+A%3BO%27Mara%2C+Shane+M%3BCoen%2C+Robert+F&isbn=&jtitle=Cortex%3B+a+journal+devoted+to+the+study+of+the+nervous+system+and+behavior&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/20153463&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.cortex.2010.01.002; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Impaired+capacity+for+autonoetic+reliving+during+autobiographical+event+recall+in+mild+Alzheimer%27s+disease&title=Cortex%3A+A+Journal+Devoted+to+the+Study+of+the+Nervous+System+and+Behavior&issn=00109452&date=2011-02-01&volume=47&issue=2&spage=236&au=Irish%2C+Muireann%3BLawlor%2C+Brian+A.%3BO%27Mara%2C+Shane+M.%3BCoen%2C+Robert+F.&isbn=&jtitle=Cortex%3A+A+Journal+Devoted+to+the+Study+of+the+Nervous+System+and+Behavior&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2010-26260-013&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.cortex.2010.01.002","Adult; Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Emotions; Imagination; Human; Episodic Memory; Imagery; episodic memory; Aging; Consciousness; Female; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; Mental Recall; Index Medicus; 3297:Neurological Disorders & Brain Damage; Neuropsychological Tests; Mental Recall -- physiology; imagery; Quantitative Study; Consciousness -- physiology; Aged (65 yrs & older); Imagination -- physiology; Emotions -- physiology; Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer Disease -- psychology; Brain Imaging; Aging -- psychology; aging; autobiographical event recall; autonoetic consciousness; Ireland; mild Alzheimer's disease; Reminiscence; Emotions/physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Imagination/physiology; Aging/psychology; Consciousness/*physiology; Alzheimer Disease/*psychology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The effect of adopting this perspective is moderated by depression such that reactivity is not reduced for individuals with particularly low levels of depressive symptoms. In the current study, we examine the effects of visual perspective on two forms of mental imagery in dysphoric and nondysphoric individuals. We attempt to replicate previous findings for recall of sad autobiographical memories and extend this research to interpretation of ambiguous situations.

However, the experience of a regrettable action tends to be painful, while regrettable inactions tend to be painful only when one considers the inaction's impact in the broader context of one's life as a whole (Gilovich & Medvec, 1995). Three experiments manipulated the visual perspective (own first-person vs. observer's third-person) that participants used to picture regretted actions or inactions from their lives. Imagery perspective influences the degree to which people's understanding of events is determined by features of the event itself (first-person) or by the integration of the event with broader self-knowledge (third-person) (Libby & Eibach, in press-b). As predicted, relative to first-person imagery, third-person imagery reduced regret for actions but increased regret for inactions. Results provide new insight into the relationship between imagery perspective, meaning-making, and emotion, and suggest ways to strategically increase or decrease regret.

MTT can be voluntarily initiated or occur involuntarily. The current exploratory study investigated involuntary and voluntary MTT in the context of trait worry, thereby bringing together research on worry and MTT. High (N=20) and low (N=16) worriers recorded involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memories and future projections using a structured diary method. We predicted that MTT in high worriers would show signs of cognitive avoidance, such as reduced emotional intensity, more observer perspective, less visual imagery, or coming up with overgeneral or less self-relevant events. We found only partial support for our hypotheses in that high worriers rated personal memories and future projections lower on measures of self-relevance than did low worriers.","2011-08","2018-06-18 10:53:43","2018-06-18 12:34:15",NA,"625-640",NA,"6","19",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","890679988; 21919590",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211.2011.595722?needAccess=true; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Involuntary+and+voluntary+mental+time+travel+in+high+and+low+worriers.&title=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&issn=1464-0686&date=2011-08-01&volume=19&issue=6&spage=625&au=Finnbogad%C3%B3ttir%2C+Hildur%3BBerntsen%2C+Dorthe&isbn=&jtitle=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/21919590&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09658211.2011.595722; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Involuntary+and+voluntary+mental+time+travel+in+high+and+low+worriers&title=Memory&issn=09658211&date=2011-08-01&volume=19&issue=6&spage=625&au=Finnbogad%C3%B3ttir%2C+Hildur%3BBerntsen%2C+Dorthe&isbn=&jtitle=Memory&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2011-21737-009&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09658211.2011.595722","Cognitive Processes; Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Emotions; Anxiety; Human; Cognition; Female; autobiographical memory; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; Index Medicus; 2340:Cognitive Processes; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; Time; Anxiety -- psychology; Memory, Episodic; Avoidance; cognitive avoidance; Interview; mental time travel; worriers; *Memory, Episodic; Anxiety/*psychology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using a novel technique to measure visual perspective, we examined where the external vantage point is situated in third-person images. Individuals in two studies were asked to recall either 10 or 15 events from their lives and describe the perspectives they experienced. Wide variation in spatial locations was observed within third-person perspectives, with the location of these perspectives relating to the event being recalled.

To address this issue, and determine what aspects of spatial memory are dependent on the head-direction system, rats with selective lateral mammillary body lesions were tested on tasks that required the use of specific spatial cues, including direction, visual allocentric, and geometric cues. Animals were first tested on a modified version of the T-maze alternation task that enabled the systematic removal of intramaze and visual allocentric cues. Rats were next tested on a geometric task that required the use of the shape of the environment to locate a hidden platform in the water-maze. The lesion rats were impaired on one stage of the T-maze alternation task and on the acquisition of the geometric task; these results are consistent with the head-direction system contributing to the processing of, and/or subsequent use, of visual allocentric and geometric cues. From the pattern of impairments it also appears that, with training, rats with lateral mammillary body lesions are able to recruit other navigational systems or that there is some degree of redundancy within the head-direction system.

These hallucinations appear real to the hallucinator. The ""realist"" approach to hallucinations suggests that hallucinations and normal perception are generated by fundamentally different mechanisms. Normal perception, dreaming, and hallucinations are equivalent because even normal perception in wakefulness is fundamentally a state of hallucinations, one however that is constrained by external physical reality. The nature and phenomenology of hallucinations can be explained more fruitfully within a framework that accepts that, similarly to hallucinations and dream imagery, normal conscious awareness of the world during wakefulness is a fundamentally subjective and dreamlike experience. Philosophical idealism predicts that normal perception, hallucinations, and dream imagery are principally manifestations of the same physiological process.

Literature shows that allocentric visual contexts in the animal's background are critical for making conditional response selections during navigations. In a traditional maze task, however, it is difficult to identify exactly which subsets of visual contexts are critically used. In the current study, we tested in rats whether making conditional response selections required the hippocampus when using computer-generated visual contextual stimuli in the animal's background as in primate and human studies. We designed a new task, visual contextual response selection (VCRS) task, in which the rat ran along a linear track and encountered a touchscreen monitor at the end of the track. The rat was required to touch one of the adjacent rectangular box images depending on the visual contextual stimuli displayed in the two peripheral monitors positioned on both sides of the center touchscreen monitor. The rats with a GABA-A receptor agonist, muscimol (MUS), infused bilaterally in the dorsal hippocampi showed severe performance deficits in the VCRS task and the impairment was completely reversible with vehicle injections. The impairment in contextual response selection with hippocampal inactivations occurred regardless of whether the visual context was presented in the side monitors or in the center touchscreen monitor. However, when the same visual contextual stimuli were pitted against each other between the two side monitors and as the rats simply ran toward the visual context associated with reward on a T-shaped track, hippocampal inactivations with MUS showed minimal disruptions, if any, in performance. Our results suggest that the hippocampus is critically involved in conditional response selection using visual stimuli in the background, but it is not required for the perceptual discrimination of those stimuli.","2012","2018-06-18 10:53:57","2018-06-18 12:38:48",NA,"66",NA,"","6",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1111864249; 23060765",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=The+hippocampus+is+required+for+visually+cued+contextual+response+selection%2C+but+not+for+visual+discrimination+of+contexts&title=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5153&date=2012-09-28&volume=6&issue=&spage=&au=Kim%2C+Sehee%3BLee%2C+Jihyun%3BLee%2C+Inah&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2012-29002-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2012.00066; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1240221693?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+hippocampus+is+required+for+visually+cued+contextual+response+selection%2C+but+not+for+visual+discrimination+of+contexts.&title=Frontiers+in+behavioral+neuroscience&issn=1662-5153&date=2012-01-01&volume=6&issue=&spage=66&au=Kim%2C+Sehee%3BLee%2C+Jihyun%3BLee%2C+Inah&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+behavioral+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/23060765&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2012.00066; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=The+hippocampus+is+required+for+visually+cued+contextual+response+selection%2C+but+not+for+visual+discrimination+of+contexts&title=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5153&date=2012-09-28&volume=6&issue=&spage=&au=Kim%2C+Sehee%3BLee%2C+Jihyun%3BLee%2C+Inah&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2012-29002-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2012.00066","Male; Cues; Episodic Memory; Hippocampus; episodic memory; article; Empirical Study; Rats; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Animal; decision making; Decision Making; Visual Discrimination; Quantitative Study; hippocampus; navigation; Choice Behavior; rats; Contextual Associations; choice behavior; context; response selection; Conditioned Responses; contextual response selection; Migratory Behavior (Animal); visual discrimination; visually cued",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Memories of negative events challenge a personâ€™s positive sense of self by suggesting that stable, positive traits that a person considers a part of his or her sense of self may not accurately describe that person. Five possible contributors to the degree to which people find an autobiographical memory challenging to the positive sense of self were identified: when the event occurred, the perspective with which the event is remembered, the personâ€™s age, the personâ€™s gender, and how meaningful the memory was. Participants were asked to identify a positive trait that describes them, and then to write a narrative of an event in which they did not act according to the selected trait. Each participant reported one event, either from the past year or from more than two years ago, and either from the first- or third-person perspective. After reporting the memory, participants completed a brief questionnaire, and responded to three ethical dilemmas (two hypothetical, one actual) that were used to measure participantsâ€™ tendency to engage in self-enhancement behavior after reporting the memories. Results found significant differences between emerging adults (age 18-29) and older adults (age 30 and above), and between men and women in the older adult group on numerous measures. Additionally, reported meaning and narrative indicators, such as emotion word use and reported harm to others, predicted performance on self-enhancement measures in both age groups. Time and perspective effects were more equivocal, but these two variables influenced responses, especially through interactions with participant variables (time and gender). Results suggest that threats to a positive sense of self can be alleviated by self-enhancement behavior in unrelated domains. Furthermore, results encourage the practice of analyzing memory narrative content to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of recalling significant events. Finally, results support the practice of considering adult development, both regarding changes in the sense of self and regarding influences of gender at different ages as a variable that shapes the content of autobiographical memories.","2012","2018-06-18 10:53:58","2018-06-18 12:35:02",NA,"",159,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Rutgers The State University of New Jersey - New Brunswick","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1284154205",NA,NA,"3550428",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Maintaining+a+positive+sense+of+self%3A+Distancing+effects+in+autobiographical+memory+for+negative+events&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Grysman%2C+Azriel&isbn=9781267875099&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Maintaining+a+positive+sense+of+self%3A+Distancing+effects+in+autobiographical+memory+for+negative+events&issn=&date=2013-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Grysman%2C+Azriel&isbn=978-1-267-87509-9&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-99220-445&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Maintaining+a+positive+sense+of+self%3A+Distancing+effects+in+autobiographical+memory+for+negative+events&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Grysman%2C+Azriel&isbn=9781267875099&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Maintaining+a+positive+sense+of+self%3A+Distancing+effects+in+autobiographical+memory+for+negative+events&issn=&date=2013-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Grysman%2C+Azriel&isbn=978-1-267-87509-9&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-99220-445&rft_id=info:doi/","Male; Human; Motivation; Psychology; Female; autobiographical memory; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Empirical Study; 0620:Developmental psychology; Developmental psychology; Autobiographical Memory; Autobiographical memory; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Middle Age (40-64 yrs); autobiographical memories; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Self; Quantitative Study; Aged (65 yrs & older); 0633:Cognitive psychology; Cognitive psychology; 0625:Personality psychology; Adult development; Distancing; Gender differences; Meaning-making; Negative events; Personality psychology; 2800:Developmental Psychology; adult development; adult group; Age Differences; age groups; emerging adults; ethical dilemmas; memory narrative content; narrative indicators; negative events; participant variables; perspective effects; positive sense; positive traits; Self-Psychology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

E.","A cognitive approach to irritable bowel syndrome","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415012085?accountid=14182","Within this thesis the role of cognitive processes in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) will be examined. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the rate of psychiatric comorbidity in IBS participants, relative to controls, was performed. Evidence supported heightened rates of psychiatric disorder. A novel hypothesis regarding overlapping cognitive vulnerability to IBS and psychiatric disorders was found to fit well with the pattern of comorbidity. Competing hypotheses and the potential moderators were examined. Overall, no single model of psychiatric morbidity in IBS could fully account for the results of the meta-analysis. The implications of this meta-analysis for a cognitive approach to IBS are discussed. Cognitive processes were directly investigated in two experiments. First, in a modified exogenous cueing task, which assessed attention to pain words, there was faster orienting towards, and engagement with pain words in IBS participants relative to controls. Next, participants completed a primed lexical decision task, which indexed interpretation biases by measuring response times to targets after ambiguous illness primes. Relative to controls, IBS participantsâ€™ responses were slower to target words presented after ambiguous illness primes, and demonstrated priming for targets related to the neutral meaning of the illness prime. In the second study, different IBS and healthy control participants completed an internet-based survey of autobiographical memory. Participants described and rated painful and emotional autobiographical events. IBS participants reported pain memories from a more observer perspective relative to controls, suggesting a possible coping strategy for pain content. Finally, three cognitive styles, alexithymia, rumination and self-blame, were evaluated using existing and novel self-report measures. Overall, when compared with healthy participants, IBS participants reported: less difficulty identifying feelings as indexed by the alexithymia measure; increased pain-focused rumination; and a general, negative self-blame.

This thesis examines the importance of the anterior thalamic nuclei, a diencephalic structure, for different elements (what, when, where) of episodic memory (or episodic-like memory) in rats. The overall goal was to understand why this region is so critical for normal memory in humans. An initial series of experiments investigated the ability of rats with anterior thalamic lesions to recognise objects and odours with a variety of delays. These experiments found that anterior thalamic lesions spare item recognition (what). This same ability was further explored with the use of the immediate early gene zif268, and the results again indicated that this thalamic nucleus does not have a direct role in recognition. A related series of studies explored the effects of anterior thalamic lesions on temporal order judgments (when) for objects. Two different discrimination procedures were tested, between-block recency and within-block recency. Lesions to the anterior thalamic nuclei selectively impaired performance on within-block recency but spared between-block recency. The ability of rats with anterior thalamic damage to discriminate between two locations (where) in both complex and simple environments was also tested. Anterior thalamic lesions significantly impaired place learning compared with control animals, despite the finding that rats with anterior thalamic lesions could sometimes discriminate between the two locations (i.e., could perform significantly above chance). In addition, the effects of anterior thalamic damage on biconditional learning (what-where conjunction) were examined. The rats were trained on both item-place and item-context associations. Lesions to the anterior thalamic nuclei disrupted acquisition of the former, but not the latter. The results suggest that the contributions of the rodent anterior thalamic nuclei to episodic memory, as part of the extended-hippocampal system, primarily reflect the involvement of these nuclei in allocentric spatial learning.","2012","2018-06-18 10:54:02","2018-06-18 12:33:58",NA,"",1,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Cardiff University (United Kingdom)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1442475264",NA,NA,"U599329",NA,"; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+role+of+the+anterior+thalamic+nuclei+for+properties+of+episodic+memory%3A+what%2C+when%2C+where&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Dumont%2C+Julie+R.&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+role+of+the+anterior+thalamic+nuclei+for+properties+of+episodic+memory%3A+what%2C+when%2C+where&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Dumont%2C+Julie+R.&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","0317:Neurosciences; Biological sciences; Neurosciences; Psychology--Abstracting, Bibliographies, Statistics; (UMI)AAIU599329; http://orca.cf.ac.uk/41978/",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Will this tendency become more salient in a context of culturally sustained egocentrism and self-focus, influencing how individuals perceive and retain information beyond immediate personal experiences? To answer this question, the present study examined long-term memory for public events in middle-aged adults from the U.S., England, Germany, Turkey, and China (total N = 274). Participants recalled within a five-minute period public events occurring in their lifetime, and provided information of personal context details of first learning of the events. Compared with British, Germans, Turkish, and Chinese, Americans had greater remembrance of public events about their own country while showing impoverished recall of foreign events. The findings are discussed in light of the role of culturally sustained self-focus in processing and remembering event information. They further have important implications for policy and education in the current global context.

Episodic memory impairment is a defining feature of early AD. The hippocampal formation (HF), a major network involved in both memory formation and retrieval is one of the first areas affected by AD pathology. However, the aetiology of AD is unknown; specifically how AÎ² and tau pathologies cause memory impairment and how the physiological function of HF is affected. In this thesis, the 3xTgAD mouse was used as a high fidelity model of human AD pathological progression to study the function of HF during early (intracellular AÎ²) and more progressive (extracellular plaque and hyperphosphorylated tau pathology) AD stages, referred to as â€˜youngâ€™ and â€˜oldâ€™ respectively. Specifically we: i) applied the hippocampal-dependent What-Where-Which (WWWhich) task to study the onset and progression of episodic-like memory decline (previously uncharacterised in the 3xTgAD mouse); ii) examined allocentric spatial memory in radial arm water maze (RAWM) and spontaneous alternation (SA) behaviour in T-Maze to discern whether cognitive differences exist between spontaneous and negatively reinforced tasks (the latter could be influenced by an exaggerated stress response); and iii) performed electrophysiological recordings in vivo from the HF of urethane-anaesthetised 3xTgAD and control mice to study basic synaptic connectivity, short-term synaptic plasticity and neuronal reverberation across the CA1-DG axis using a multi-site electrode. Our results showed an early and specific deficit for WWWhich episodic-like memory in the 3xTgAD model, with a decline in performance witnessed in mice as young as 3 months. In contrast, 3xTgAD component memory comprising single or dual associations of â€˜Whatâ€™, â€˜Whereâ€™, â€˜Whichâ€™ and â€˜Whenâ€™ remained intact suggesting the episodic impairment was due to dysfunction during the association of three component information streams within hippocampus (Chapters 3 and 4). 3xTgAD mice were equally impaired for allocentric spatial memory in RAWM and in their SA behaviour, suggesting no inherent advantage of examining cognition in paradigms which elicit behavioural distress (Chapter 5). We witnessed the development of subtle synaptic abnormalities in young 3xTgAD mice in the form of enhanced short-term paired pulse facilitation in CA1 and DG, however, a paucity of response facilitation in CA1 in response to train stimulation. In contrast, we saw intact basic synaptic function (fibre integrity and synaptic connectivity) in 3xTgAD mice of both young and old ages, suggesting gross hippocampal circuitry remained in place (Chapter 6). Finally, we saw an effect of normal ageing on cognition in the WWWhich and spatial tasks (Chapters 4 and 5), and a decline in neuronal reverberation with age in control and 3xTgAD mice. Dysfunction in these two parameters (behavioural and electrophysiological) coincided with the onset of intracellular AÎ² accumulation within HF in 3xTgAD mice. This suggests a role of intracellular AÎ² in impairing the physiological function of HF in AD which translates as cognitive decline in hippocampal-dependent forms of memory. Episodic memory was found to be especially sensitive to AD-related pathology and impairment, thus the WWWhich task may be applied to faithfully study the onset of cognitive decline in other AD mouse models. Further examination of the relative contribution of AÎ² to hippocampal dysfunction in the 3xTgAD model is required.","2012","2018-06-18 10:54:07","2018-06-18 12:33:43",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"The University of Manchester (United Kingdom)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1774233590",NA,NA,"10029533",NA,"; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Hippocampal+dysfunction+in+the+3xtgad+mouse+model+of+alzheimer%27s+disease&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Davis%2C+Katherine&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Hippocampal+dysfunction+in+the+3xtgad+mouse+model+of+alzheimer%27s+disease&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Davis%2C+Katherine&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","Psychology--Abstracting, Bibliographies, Statistics; (UMI)AAI10029533; 9998:No UMI subject assigned; https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/hippocampal-dysfunction-in-the-3xtgad-mouse-model-of-alzheimers-disease(ba2d4704-9e22-4213-8bc7-a1c55a0e0ccd).html; No UMI subject assigned; Social sciences",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Functional and structural MRI was used to investigate the neural correlates of allocentric spatial memory in schizotypal personality. Allocentric spatial memory is reported to be impaired in schizophrenia and this is thought to be related to alterations in hippocampal function and structure. Previous literature suggests individuals with schizotypal personality traits have a similar cognitive and neural profile to schizophrenia spectrum disorders for example reduced hippocampal volumes and compromised cognition. It was therefore hypothesised that high schizotypy would be associated with worse performance on these tasks and a different pattern of functional activation in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus compared to controls. No behavioural differences were observed on the cognitive measures in this thesis. Investigation of brain function revealed decreased volume of the right hippocampus and bilateral medial frontal gyrus and increased volume of the posterior cingulate, superior temporal gyrus and anterior prefrontal cortex, in line with previous literature. Functional MRI revealed decreased activation of the right hippocampus during memory encoding and increased activation of the hippocampus bilaterally during memory retrieval in high schizotypy compared to controls. Memory retrieval was also associated with increased activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and insular cortex in this group. Further, activation of the right hippocampus is related to better performance across allocentric spatial memory tasks in controls but this relationship is absent in high schizotypy.","2012","2018-06-18 10:54:08","2018-06-19 10:15:07",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"University of London, King's College (United Kingdom)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1784057294",NA,NA,"10059089",NA,"; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+neural+correlates+of+allocentric+spatial+memory+in+schizotypy&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=McMullen%2C+Katrina&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=The+neural+correlates+of+allocentric+spatial+memory+in+schizotypy&issn=&date=2012-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=McMullen%2C+Katrina&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","(UMI)AAI10059089; 9998:No UMI subject assigned; https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-neural-correlates-of-allocentric-spatial-memory-in-schizotypy(ca905044-0748-42e1-a322-8cf74504ea01).html; No UMI subject assigned; Psychology--Abstracting, Bibliographies, Statistics; Social sciences",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study included subjects from three different populations: healthy older adults, patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and patients with early to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).

Here, the participants were successively immersed in two virtual environments; the first, as the driver of a virtual car (active exploration) and the second, as the passenger of that car (passive exploration). Subjects were instructed to encode all elements of the environment as well as the associated spatiotemporal contexts. Following each immersion, we assessed the patientâ€™s recall and recognition of central information (i.e., the elements of the environment), contextual information (i.e., temporal, egocentric and allocentric spatial information) and lastly, the quality of binding. We found that the AD patientsâ€™ performances were inferior to that of the aMCI and even more to that of the healthy aged groups, in line with the progression of hippocampal atrophy reported in the literature. Spatial allocentric memory assessments were found to be particularly useful for distinguishing aMCI patients from healthy older adults. Active exploration yielded enhanced recall of central and allocentric spatial information, as well as binding in all groups. This led aMCI patients to achieve better performance scores on immediate temporal memory tasks. Finally, the patientsâ€™ daily memory complaints were more highly correlated with the performances on the virtual test than with their performances on the classical memory test. Taken together, these results highlight specific cognitive differences found between these three populations that may provide additional insight into the early diagnosis and rehabilitation of pathological aging. In particular, neuropsychological studies would benefit to use virtual tests and a multi-component approach to assess episodic memory, and encourage active encoding of information in patients suffering from mild or severe age-related memory impairment. The beneficial effect of active encoding on episodic memory in aMCI and early to moderate AD is discussed in the context of relatively preserved frontal and motor brain functions implicated in self-referential effects and procedural abilities.

Patient M.R. suffers from amnesia, due to bilateral hippocampal lesion and temporoparietal atrophy following carbon monoxide poisoning. We compared his performance in immediate spatial memory tasks with the performance of ten healthy matched participants. Using an immediate reproduction of path, we observed a dissociation between his performance in three allocentric tasks and in five egocentric-updating tasks. His performance was always impaired on tasks requiring the use of an egocentric-updating representation but remained preserved on allocentric tasks. These results fit with the hypothesis that the hippocampus plays a role in spatial memory, but they also suggest that allocentric deficits previously observed in amnesia might actually reflect deficits in egocentric-updating processes. Furthermore, the cooccurrence of deficits in episodic long-term memory and short-term egocentric-updating representation without any short-term allocentric deficit suggests a new link between the mnemonic and navigational roles of the hippocampus. The Cognitive Map theory, the Multiple Trace theory, as well as further models linking spatial and nonspatial functions of the hippocampus are discussed.

This relative ease and speed with which information is processed is defined as fluency and can constitute a basis for memory judgment. Fluency can also be manipulated on line by perceptual bias (e.g., levels of noise), leading to an increase in recognition for items processed more fluently (e.g., items with less noise). Previous experiments using Remember-Know paradigm have shown an impact of perceptual fluency only on familiarity and not on recollection. Recent episodic memory models have postulated a strong link between episodic memory and spatial processes, especially with egocentric updating (Gomez et al. in Acta Psychol 132(3):221-227, 2009). The present experiment was conducted to determine whether self-motion fluency affects recognition performance and particularly has an impact on ""Remember"" responses. Thirty participants learned a 4-min path movie and then had to recognize among short paths if they were part of the learned path, followed by a Remember-Know procedure for recognized items. Self-motion fluency was manipulated with the presence of nimble acceleration applied on a small part of the recognition paths. Results show that the presence of a self-motion fluency increases significantly the proportion of remember responses solely on learned paths. This study spotlights for the first time a specific fluency effect on recollection and indicates an implication of egocentric-updating processing in episodic memory retrieval.","2012-08","2018-06-18 10:54:20","2018-06-18 12:32:00",NA,"S121-S124",NA,"","13 Suppl 1",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1036878419; 22806647",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Bias+in+self-motion+perceived+speed+can+enhance+episodic+memory.&title=Cognitive+processing&issn=1612-4790&date=2012-08-01&volume=13+Suppl+1&issue=&spage=S121&au=Cerles%2C+M%C3%A9lanie%3BRousset%2C+St%C3%A9phane&isbn=&jtitle=Cognitive+processing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/22806647&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10339-012-0447-y; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1036878419?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Bias+in+self-motion+perceived+speed+can+enhance+episodic+memory.&title=Cognitive+processing&issn=1612-4790&date=2012-08-01&volume=13+Suppl+1&issue=&spage=S121&au=Cerles%2C+M%C3%A9lanie%3BRousset%2C+St%C3%A9phane&isbn=&jtitle=Cognitive+processing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/22806647&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10339-012-0447-y; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Bias+in+self-motion+perceived+speed+can+enhance+episodic+memory&title=Cognitive+Processing&issn=16124782&date=2012-08-01&volume=13&issue=Suppl+1&spage=S121&au=Cerles%2C+M%C3%A9lanie%3BRousset%2C+St%C3%A9phane&isbn=&jtitle=Cognitive+Processing&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2012-23528-015&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs10339-012-0447-y","Performance; Adult; Humans; Male; Human; Episodic Memory; episodic memory; Bias; Adolescent; Female; Photic Stimulation; Young Adult; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Analysis of Variance; Index Medicus; Space Perception; User-Computer Interface; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; 2300:Human Experimental Psychology; Retention; Recognition (Psychology); Memory, Episodic; Interview; Motion Perception -- physiology; Bias (Epidemiology); Motion Perception; recognition performance; remember responses; Responses; self motion fluency; Stimulus Parameters; stimulus reprocessing; *Memory, Episodic; *Bias; Motion Perception/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Alternatively, rememberers may adopt a third-person or observer perspective, so that they ""see"" themselves as actors in the memory image. As is true of psychology itself, the distinction between field (F) and observer (O) perspectives has a long past but a short history. The concept of multiple memory perspectives can itself be viewed from multiple research perspectives. To illustrate this point, we begin with a review of cognitive and social aspects of the field/observer distinction. Next we discuss a recent study in which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), recall narratives, and subjective ratings were combined with a view to identifying the neural networks engaged by field versus observer perspectives. Attention will then shift to the clinical significance of the memory perspectives, before settling at the end on promising directions for future research.

Exceedingly detailed symbols that describe patterns of activity rapidly self-organizing, at each cycle of the Î¸ rhythm, in the hippocampus are instances of unitary conscious experience that jointly constitute the stream of consciousness. Integrating object information (derived from the ventral visual stream and orbitofrontal cortex) with contextual emotional information (from the anterior insula) and spatial environmental information (from the dorsal visual stream), the hippocampus rapidly forms event codes that have the informational content of objects embedded in an emotional and spatiotemporally extending context. Event codes, formed in the CA3-dentate network for the purpose of their memorization, are not only contextualized but also allocentric representations, similarly to conscious experiences of events and objects situated in a seemingly objective and observer-independent framework of phenomenal space and time. Conscious perception, creating the spatially and temporally extending world that we perceive around us, is likely to be evolutionarily related to more fleeting and seemingly internal forms of conscious experience, such as autobiographical memory recall, mental imagery, including goal anticipation, and to other forms of externalized conscious experience, namely dreaming and hallucinations; and evidence pointing to an important contribution of the hippocampus to these conscious phenomena will be reviewed.","2013","2018-06-18 10:54:30","2018-06-18 12:26:49",NA,"304",NA,"","4",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1366820171; 23755033",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Conscious+experience+and+episodic+memory%3A+Hippocampus+at+the+crossroads&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2013-05-30&volume=4&issue=&spage=&au=Behrendt%2C+Ralf-Peter&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-22562-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1420147641?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Conscious+experience+and+episodic+memory%3A+hippocampus+at+the+crossroads.&title=Frontiers+in+psychology&issn=16641078&date=2013-01-01&volume=4&issue=&spage=304&au=Behrendt%2C+Ralf-Peter&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/23755033&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffpsyg.2013.00304; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Conscious+experience+and+episodic+memory%3A+Hippocampus+at+the+crossroads&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2013-05-30&volume=4&issue=&spage=&au=Behrendt%2C+Ralf-Peter&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-22562-001&rft_id=info:doi/","Human; Episodic Memory; mental imagery; Imagery; Hippocampus; default-mode network; episodic memory; article; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Animal; Neurons; consciousness; Consciousness States; Visual Memory; Visual Perception; hippocampus; schizophrenia; hallucinations; emotional feelings; Î¸ oscillations; 2380:Consciousness States; conscious experience; Dualism; Neurocognition; neuronal firing; Physiological Correlates; theta oscillations",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies using a variety of paradigms involving self-performed actions argue in favor of perspective taking confusion in hallucination-prone subjects. However, our understanding of such processes during adolescence is still at an early stage. The present study thus aims (1) to delineate the neural correlates sustaining mental simulation of actions involving self-performed actions (first-person perspective; 1PP) and other-performed actions (third-person perspective; 3PP) during adolescence (2) to identify atypical activation patterns during 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions in hallucination-prone adolescents (3) to examine whether differential risk for schizophrenia (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments in the 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions during adolescence. Twenty-two typically developing controls (Control group; 6 females), 12 hallucination-prone adolescents [auditory hallucination (AH) group; 7 females] and 13 adolescents with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS group; 4 females) were included in the study. During the fMRI task, subjects were presented with a cue (self-other priming cues) indicating to perform the task using either a first person perspective (""you""-1PP) or a third person perspective (""best friend""-3PP) and then they were asked to mentally simulate actions based on the type of cue. Hallucination-proneness was assessed using a self-report questionnaire [Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS)]. Our results indicated that atypical patterns of cerebral activation, particularly in the key areas of self-other distinction, were found in both groups at risk for auditory hallucinations (AHs and 22q11.2DS). More precisely, adolescents in the AH group presented decreased activations in the right middle occipital gyrus BA19, left cingulate gyrus BA31, and right precuneus BA31 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. Adolescents in the 22q11.2DS group presented decreased activations in the right superior occipital gyrus BA19, left caudate tail and left precuneus BA7 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. In comparison to the Control group, only the 22q11.2DS adolescents showed a decreased activation for other-related cues (prime other > prime self contrast) in areas of visual imagery, episodic memory and social cognition. This study characterizes the neural correlates of mental imagery for actions during adolescence, and suggests that a differential risk for hallucination-proneness (clinical vs. genetic) is associated to similar patterns of atypical activations in key areas sustaining self-other discrimination processes. These observations may provide relevant information for future research and prevention strategies with regards to hallucination-proneness during adolescence.","2013","2018-06-18 10:54:33","2018-06-18 12:33:39",NA,"329",NA,"","7",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1399934636; 23847502",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Action+simulation+in+hallucination-prone+adolescents&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2013-07-04&volume=7&issue=&spage=&au=Dahoun%2C+Tarik%3BEliez%2C+Stephan%3BChen%2C+Fei%3BBadoud%2C+Deborah%3BSchneider%2C+Maude%3BLar%C3%B8i%2C+Frank%3BDebbane%2C+Martin&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-26012-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2013.00329; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1429643829?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701149/pdf/fnhum-07-00329.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Action+simulation+in+hallucination-prone+adolescents.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2013-01-01&volume=7&issue=&spage=329&au=Dahoun%2C+Tarik%3BEliez%2C+Stephan%3BChen%2C+Fei%3BBadoud%2C+Deborah%3BSchneider%2C+Maude%3BLar%C3%B8i%2C+Frank%3BDebbane%2C+Martin&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/23847502&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2013.00329; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Action+simulation+in+hallucination-prone+adolescents&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2013-07-04&volume=7&issue=&spage=&au=Dahoun%2C+Tarik%3BEliez%2C+Stephan%3BChen%2C+Fei%3BBadoud%2C+Deborah%3BSchneider%2C+Maude%3BLar%C3%B8i%2C+Frank%3BDebbane%2C+Martin&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-26012-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2013.00329","Male; Human; Simulation; fMRI; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Electrical Activity; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Belgium; Quantitative Study; Childhood (birth-12 yrs); School Age (6-12 yrs); France; perspective taking; Role Taking; Biological Neural Networks; Brain Imaging; Hallucinations; 22q11.2; action simulation; auditory hallucinations; perspective-taking; Adolescent Development; hallucination prone adolescents; Outpatient; Switzerland",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In computational applications, GW architectures recruit many distributed, specialized agents to cooperate in resolving focal ambiguities. In the brain, conscious experiences may reflect a GW function. For animals, the natural world is full of unpredictable dangers and opportunities, suggesting a general adaptive pressure for brains to resolve focal ambiguities quickly and accurately. GW theory aims to understand the differences between conscious and unconscious brain events. In humans and related species the cortico-thalamic (C-T) core is believed to underlie conscious aspects of perception, thinking, learning, feelings of knowing (FOK), felt emotions, visual imagery, working memory, and executive control. Alternative theoretical perspectives are also discussed. The C-T core has many anatomical hubs, but conscious percepts are unitary and internally consistent at any given moment. Over time, conscious contents constitute a very large, open set. This suggests that a brain-based GW capacity cannot be localized in a single anatomical hub. Rather, it should be sought in a functional hub - a dynamic capacity for binding and propagation of neural signals over multiple task-related networks, a kind of neuronal cloud computing. In this view, conscious contents can arise in any region of the C-T core when multiple input streams settle on a winner-take-all equilibrium. The resulting conscious gestalt may ignite an any-to-many broadcast, lasting âˆ¼100-200â€‰ms, and trigger widespread adaptation in previously established networks. To account for the great range of conscious contents over time, the theory suggests an open repertoire of binding coalitions that can broadcast via theta/gamma or alpha/gamma phase coupling, like radio channels competing for a narrow frequency band. Conscious moments are thought to hold only 1-4 unrelated items; this small focal capacity may be the biological price to pay for global access. Visuotopic maps in cortex specialize in features like color, retinal size, motion, object identity, and egocentric/allocentric framing, so that a binding coalition for the sight of a rolling billiard ball in nearby space may resonate among activity maps of LGN, V1-V4, MT, IT, as well as the dorsal stream. Spatiotopic activity maps can bind into coherent gestalts using adaptive resonance (reentry). Single neurons can join a dominant coalition by phase tuning to regional oscillations in the 4-12â€‰Hz range. Sensory percepts may bind and broadcast from posterior cortex, while non-sensory FOKs may involve prefrontal and frontotemporal areas. The anatomy and physiology of the hippocampal complex suggest a GW architecture as well. In the intact brain the hippocampal complex may support conscious event organization as well as episodic memory storage.","2013","2018-06-18 10:54:35","2018-06-18 12:26:22",NA,"200",NA,"","4",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1428272196; 23974723",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Global+workspace+dynamics%3A+Cortical+%22binding+and+propagation%22+enables+conscious+contents&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2013-05-28&volume=4&issue=&spage=&au=Baars%2C+Bernard+J.%3BFranklin%2C+Stan%3BRamsoy%2C+Thomas+Zoega&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-26692-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffpsyg.2013.00200; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1426225809?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Global+workspace+dynamics%3A+cortical+%22binding+and+propagation%22+enables+conscious+contents.&title=Frontiers+in+psychology&issn=16641078&date=2013-01-01&volume=4&issue=&spage=200&au=Baars%2C+Bernard+J%3BFranklin%2C+Stan%3BRamsoy%2C+Thomas+Zoega&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/23974723&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffpsyg.2013.00200; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Global+workspace+dynamics%3A+Cortical+%22binding+and+propagation%22+enables+conscious+contents&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2013-05-28&volume=4&issue=&spage=&au=Baars%2C+Bernard+J.%3BFranklin%2C+Stan%3BRamsoy%2C+Thomas+Zoega&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-26692-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffpsyg.2013.00200","Human; Hippocampus; attention; article; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Animal; Neurons; consciousness; Consciousness States; Brain; brain; neurons; awareness; brain dynamics; cortex; global workspace theory; theoretical biology; voluntary control; binding; Cell Signaling; conscious contents; coupled signaling elements; focal ambiguities; global workspace; Receptor Binding; Stimulus Ambiguity",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, before 2 years of age, children are unable to form or store episodic memories for recall later in life, a phenomenon known as infantile amnesia. Here, we studied the development of allocentric spatial memory, a fundamental component of episodic memory, in two versions of a real-world memory task requiring 18 month- to 5-year-old children to search for rewards hidden beneath cups distributed in an open-field arena. Whereas children 25â€“42-months-old were not capable of discriminating three reward locations among 18 possible locations in absence of local cues marking these locations, children older than 43 months found the reward locations reliably. These results support previous findings suggesting that allocentric spatial memory, if present, is only rudimentary in children under 3.5 years of age. However, when tested with only one reward location among four possible locations, children 25â€“39-months-old found the reward reliably in absence of local cues, whereas 18â€“23-month-olds did not. Our findings thus show that the ability to form a basic allocentric representation of the environment is present by 2 years of age, and its emergence coincides temporally with the offset of infantile amnesia. However, the ability of children to distinguish and remember closely related spatial locations improves from 2 to 3.5 years of age, a developmental period marked by persistent deficits in long-term episodic memory known as childhood amnesia. These findings support the hypothesis that the differential maturation of distinct hippocampal circuits contributes to the emergence of specific memory processes during early childhood.

We also compared the memory perspective from which patients recollected these events. Patients were selectively impaired in recollecting episodic details of events encoded during mania but not depression or euthymia. No significant differences emerged between patients and controls for recollection of non-episodic details, regardless of mood state.

Perception may be taken from a self-referenced first-person-perspective or from a third-person-perspective. Correspondingly, in the affective plane, emotion may be self-referenced, reflecting the experiencer own-feelings, or may be dominated by a third-person-perspective, when the experiencer is absorbed in the life of others. Taken together, this suggests that different aspects of the subjective experience should be regarded in relation to the experiencing self. Self-related mentalization may have a specific logarithmic pattern, reflected as a â€œmental-line.â€ The temporo-parietal junction may play a special role in mediating these self-referenced functions in the different domains.

The results suggest that maladaptive RT is associated with increased emotional response to mentally travelling to negative events and with reduced specificity of past MTT. The results for sensory reliving and field-observer perspective were mixed. We discuss why maladaptive RT is associated with both increased emotional response and reduced specificity, which has been suggested to decrease emotional responses to MTT. We suggest that differences in the conceptualization of maladaptive RT and sampling clinical versus healthy participants may explain this apparently contradictory finding.

There are several considerations that lead us to implicate the hippocampus in the generation of conscious perception and, ultimately, of conscious experiences of all kinds. Firstly, conscious perception of external events is intricately linked with the formation of episodic (declarative) memories, a key function attributed to the hippocampus. Secondly, conscious experience is allocentric and contextualized. Consciousness creates or simulates an image of the world that appears to surround us and to be independent of our observation of it. What is characteristic of wakeful consciousness and dreaming alike is that objects or events are experienced as being embedded in an external, that is, allocentric, frame of space and time. The hippocampus has been implicated in the rapid formation and memorization of allocentric representations that embed objects or events in a world context. Thirdly, the hippocampus is ideally positioned to bind information processed in different sensory association cortices. It is argued that rapidly forming patterns of neuronal ensemble firing in the hippocampus, particularly in region CA3, which encode arbitrary associations between objects and their spatiotemporal and emotional context, that is, associations between information derived from different neocortical processing streams, define the informational content of consciousness. Evidence suggestive of an important contribution of the hippocampus to conscious observation, mental imagery, dreaming, conscious anticipation of outcomes, and hallucinations will be reviewed.

It was found that true memories were reliably more vivid than fabricated memories and were nearly always recalled from a first-person perspective. In contrast, fabricated differed from true memories in that they were judged to be reliably older, were more frequently recalled from a third-person perspective, and linguistic analysis revealed that they required more cognitive effort to generate. No notable differences were found across modality of reporting. Finally, it was found that intentionally fabricated memories were created by recalling and then â€œeditingâ€ true memories.

On the brain level its emergence is accompanied by structural and functional reorganization of different components of the so-called EAM network. This network includes the hippocampal formation, which is viewed as being vital for the acquisition of memories of personal events for long-term storage. Developmental studies have emphasized socio-cultural-linguistic mechanisms that may be unique to the development of EAM. Furthermore it was hypothesized that one of the main functions of EAM is the social one. In the research field, the link between EAM and social cognition remains however debated. Herein we aim to bring new insights into the relation between EAM and social information processing (including social cognition) by describing a young adult patient with amnesia with neurodevelopmental mechanisms due to perinatal complications accompanied by hypoxia. The patient was investigated medically, psychiatrically, and with neuropsychological and neuroimaging methods. Structural high resolution magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant bilateral hippocampal atrophy as well as indices for degeneration in the amygdalae, basal ganglia, and thalamus, when a less conservative threshold was applied. In addition to extensive memory investigations and testing other (non-social) cognitive functions, we employed a broad range of tests that assessed social information processing (social perception, social cognition, social regulation). Our results point to both preserved (empathy, core ToM functions, visual affect selection, and discrimination, affective prosody discrimination) and impaired domains of social information processing (incongruent affective prosody processing, complex social judgments). They support proposals for a role of the hippocampal formation in processing more complex social information that likely requires multimodal relational handling.

Several autobiographical memory deficits, including low specificity of personal memories, have been identified in schizophrenia, but visual perspective during autobiographical memory retrieval has not yet been investigated in patients. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the visual perspective with which patients visualize themselves when recalling autobiographical memories and to assess the specificity of their memories which is a major determinant of visual perspective. Thirty patients with schizophrenia and 30 matched controls recalled personal events from 4 life periods. After each recall, they were asked to report their visual perspective (Field or Observer) associated with the event. The specificity of their memories was assessed by independent raters. Our results showed that patients reported significantly fewer Field perspectives than comparison participants. Patients' memories, whether recalled with Field or Observer perspectives, were less specific and less detailed. Our results indicate that patients with schizophrenia adopt Field perspectives less frequently than comparison participants, and that this may contribute to a weakened sense of the individual of being an actor of his past events, and hence to a reduced sense of self. They suggest that this may be related to low specificity of memories and that all the important aspects involved in re-experiencing autobiographical events are impaired in patients with schizophrenia.

To investigate the role of HF and PH neurons in environmental scaling in primates, we recorded neuronal activities in the monkey HF and PH during virtual navigation (VN) and pointer translocation (PT) tasks. The monkeys had to navigate within three differently sized virtual spaces with the same spatial cues (VN task) or move a pointer on a screen (PT task) by manipulating a joystick to receive a reward. Of the 234 recorded neurons, 170 and 61 neurons displayed place-related activities in the VN and PT tasks, respectively. Significant differences were observed between the HF and PH neurons. The spatial similarity of place fields between the two different virtual spaces was lower in PH than in HF, while specificities of the neuronal responses to distal spatial cues were higher in PH than in HF. Spatial view information was predominately processed in posterior PH. The spatial scales (place field sizes) of the HF and PH neurons were reduced in the reduced virtual space, as shown in rodent place cells. These results suggest the complementary roles of HF (allocentric representation of landmarks) and PH (representation of the spatial layout of landmarks) in the recognition of a location during navigation.","2014-01","2018-06-18 10:55:04","2018-06-18 12:34:28",NA,"113-130",NA,"1","24",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1467635059; 24123569",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Place-related+neuronal+activity+in+the+monkey+parahippocampal+gyrus+and+hippocampal+formation+during+virtual+navigation.&title=Hippocampus&issn=1098-1063&date=2014-01-01&volume=24&issue=1&spage=113&au=Furuya%2C+Yoichi%3BMatsumoto%2C+Jumpei%3BHori%2C+Etsuro%3BBoas%2C+Cyrus+Villas%3BTran%2C+Anh+Hai%3BShimada%2C+Yutaka%3BOno%2C+Taketoshi%3BNishijo%2C+Hisao&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24123569&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22209; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1467635059?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Place-related+neuronal+activity+in+the+monkey+parahippocampal+gyrus+and+hippocampal+formation+during+virtual+navigation.&title=Hippocampus&issn=1098-1063&date=2014-01-01&volume=24&issue=1&spage=113&au=Furuya%2C+Yoichi%3BMatsumoto%2C+Jumpei%3BHori%2C+Etsuro%3BBoas%2C+Cyrus+Villas%3BTran%2C+Anh+Hai%3BShimada%2C+Yutaka%3BOno%2C+Taketoshi%3BNishijo%2C+Hisao&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24123569&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22209; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Place-related+neuronal+activity+in+the+monkey+parahippocampal+gyrus+and+hippocampal+formation+during+virtual+navigation&title=Hippocampus&issn=10509631&date=2014-01-01&volume=24&issue=1&spage=113&au=Furuya%2C+Yoichi%3BMatsumoto%2C+Jumpei%3BHori%2C+Etsuro%3BBoas%2C+Cyrus+Villas%3BTran%2C+Anh+Hai%3BShimada%2C+Yutaka%3BOno%2C+Taketoshi%3BNishijo%2C+Hisao&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2013-43590-011&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22209; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.22209","Male; Cues; Episodic Memory; Hippocampus; Memory; article; Empirical Study; Index Medicus; Memory -- physiology; Hippocampus -- physiology; Spatial Behavior -- physiology; Animals; Neurons -- physiology; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Animal; Spatial Behavior; Monkeys; Neurons; Space Perception; Electrophysiology; Macaca; User-Computer Interface; Space Perception -- physiology; Quantitative Study; hippocampus; neuronal activity; Parahippocampal Gyrus; Parahippocampal Gyrus -- physiology; place cell; monkey; parahippocampal gyrus; hippocampal formation; monkeys; virtual navigation; Hippocampus/*physiology; Memory/*physiology; Neurons/*physiology; Parahippocampal Gyrus/*physiology; Space Perception/physiology; Spatial Behavior/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The participants were asked to recall the same events repeatedly across three sessions (S1, S2, and S3): S2 was conducted about three days after S1, and S3 was conducted about four weeks after S2. The results showed a reduction in the emotional intensity of the recalled events when the perspective was changed from field to observer at S2. More importantly, this reduction in emotional intensity persisted until S3. These effects were not observed under observer-to-field perspective change at S2.

Here, we argue that a crucial role for an episodic retrieval is played by a ""mental frame syncing"" between two kinds of allocentric representations. This neurocognitive process allows an effective retrieval of our past experiences by synchronizing the allocentric view-point independent representation with the allocentric view-point dependent representation. If the ""mental frame syncing"" stops, even momentarily, it is difficult to reconstruct a coherent spatial scaffold upon which to effectively retrieve our previous events within an egocentric perspective. This is what apparently happens in Alzheimer's disease: a break in the ""mental frame syncing"" between these two kinds of allocentric representations, underpinned by damage to the hippocampus, may contribute significantly to the early deficit in episodic memory.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:09","2018-06-19 10:18:06",NA,"33",NA,"","6",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1509409942; 24653696",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=What+is+the+role+of+spatial+processing+in+the+decline+of+episodic+memory+in+Alzheimer%27s+disease%3F+The+%22mental+frame+syncing%22+hypothesis.&title=Frontiers+in+aging+neuroscience&issn=16634365&date=2014-01-01&volume=6&issue=&spage=33&au=Serino%2C+Silvia%3BRiva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+aging+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24653696&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnagi.2014.00033; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1509409942?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947988/pdf/fnagi-06-00033.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=What+is+the+role+of+spatial+processing+in+the+decline+of+episodic+memory+in+Alzheimer%27s+disease%3F+The+%22mental+frame+syncing%22+hypothesis.&title=Frontiers+in+aging+neuroscience&issn=16634365&date=2014-01-01&volume=6&issue=&spage=33&au=Serino%2C+Silvia%3BRiva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+aging+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24653696&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnagi.2014.00033; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=What+is+the+role+of+spatial+processing+in+the+decline+of+episodic+memory+in+Alzheimer%E2%80%99s+disease%3F+The+%22mental+frame+syncing%22+hypothesis&title=Frontiers+in+Aging+Neuroscience&issn=1663-4365&date=2014-03-10&volume=6&issue=&spage=&au=Serino%2C+Silvia%3BRiva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Aging+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-16350-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnagi.2014.00033","2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; 3297:Neurological Disorders & Brain Damage; allocentric frame of reference; allocentric view point; Allocentrism; Alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimerâ€™s disease; Animal; article; Cognition; egocentric frame of reference; episodic memory; Episodic Memory; Frame of Reference; Human; mental frame syncing; Spatial Ability; spatial cognition",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Further, hippocampal anomalies have also been observed in schizophrenia. This study investigated whether average hippocampal gray matter (GM) would differentiate performance on a hippocampus-dependent memory task in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Twenty-one patients with schizophrenia and 22 control participants were scanned with an MRI while being tested on a wayfinding task in a virtual town (e.g., find the grocery store from the school). Regressions were performed for both groups individually and together using GM and performance on the wayfinding task. Results indicate that controls successfully completed the task more often than patients, took less time, and made fewer errors. Additionally, controls had significantly more hippocampal GM than patients. Poor performance was associated with a GM decrease in the right hippocampus for both groups. Within group regressions found an association between right hippocampi GM and performance in controls and an association between the left hippocampi GM and performance in patients. A second analysis revealed that different anatomical GM regions, known to be associated with the hippocampus, such as the parahippocampal cortex, amygdala, medial, and orbital prefrontal cortices, covaried with the hippocampus in the control group. Interestingly, the cuneus and cingulate gyrus also covaried with the hippocampus in the patient group but the orbital frontal cortex did not, supporting the hypothesis of impaired connectivity between the hippocampus and the frontal cortex in schizophrenia. These results present important implications for creating intervention programs aimed at measuring functional and structural changes in the hippocampus in schizophrenia.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:11","2018-06-19 10:13:34",NA,"88",NA,"","8",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1511397627; 24672451",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Structural+hippocampal+anomalies+in+a+schizophrenia+population+correlate+with+navigation+performance+on+a+wayfinding+task&title=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5153&date=2014-03-14&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Ledoux%2C+Andr%C3%A9e-Anne%3BBoyer%2C+Patrice%3BPhillips%2C+Jennifer+L.%3BLabelle%2C+Alain%3BSmith%2C+Andra%3BBohbot%2C+V%C3%A9ronique+D.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-19131-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2014.00088; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1552606367?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3953714/pdf/fnbeh-08-00088.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Structural+hippocampal+anomalies+in+a+schizophrenia+population+correlate+with+navigation+performance+on+a+wayfinding+task.&title=Frontiers+in+behavioral+neuroscience&issn=16625153&date=2014-01-01&volume=8&issue=&spage=88&au=Ledoux%2C+Andr%C3%A9e-Anne%3BBoyer%2C+Patrice%3BPhillips%2C+Jennifer+L%3BLabelle%2C+Alain%3BSmith%2C+Andra%3BBohbot%2C+V%C3%A9ronique+D&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+behavioral+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24672451&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2014.00088; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Structural+hippocampal+anomalies+in+a+schizophrenia+population+correlate+with+navigation+performance+on+a+wayfinding+task&title=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5153&date=2014-03-14&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Ledoux%2C+Andr%C3%A9e-Anne%3BBoyer%2C+Patrice%3BPhillips%2C+Jennifer+L.%3BLabelle%2C+Alain%3BSmith%2C+Andra%3BBohbot%2C+V%C3%A9ronique+D.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-19131-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2014.00088","Male; Human; Episodic Memory; Hippocampus; Schizophrenia; episodic memory; Female; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Spatial Memory; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Canada; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; allocentric strategy; hippocampus; spatial memory; Wayfinding; 3213:Schizophrenia & Psychotic States; schizophrenia; Brain Imaging; Interview; Outpatient; psychiatric population; VBM; MRI; navigation performance; voxel based morphometry; wayfinding task; Vbm",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular two influential models-the revised cognitive-interpersonal maintenance model and the transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral theory-identified possible key predisposing and maintaining factors. These models, even if very influential and able to provide clear suggestions for therapy, still are not able to provide answers to several critical questions: why do not all the individuals with obsessive compulsive features, anxious avoidance or with a dysfunctional scheme for self-evaluation develop an ED? What is the role of the body experience in the etiology of these disorders? In this paper we suggest that the path to a meaningful answer requires the integration of these models with the recent outcomes of cognitive neuroscience. First, our bodily representations are not just a way to map an external space but the main tool we use to generate meaning, organize our experience, and shape our social identity. In particular, we will argue that our bodily experience evolves over time by integrating six different representations of the body characterized by specific pathologies-body schema (phantom limb), spatial body (unilateral hemi-neglect), active body (alien hand syndrome), personal body (autoscopic phenomena), objectified body (xenomelia) and body image (body dysmorphia). Second, these representations include either schematic (allocentric) or perceptual (egocentric) contents that interact within the working memory of the individual through the alignment between the retrieved contents from long-term memory and the ongoing egocentric contents from perception. In this view EDs may be the outcome of an impairment in the ability of updating a negative body representation stored in autobiographical memory (allocentric) with real-time sensorimotor and proprioceptive data (egocentric).","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:13","2018-06-19 10:16:58",NA,"236",NA,"","8",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1525770184; 24834042",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Out+of+my+real+body%3A+Cognitive+neuroscience+meets+eating+disorders&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2014-05-06&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-45271-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1658440194?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Out+of+my+real+body%3A+cognitive+neuroscience+meets+eating+disorders.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2014-01-01&volume=8&issue=&spage=236&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24834042&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2014.00236; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Out+of+my+real+body%3A+Cognitive+neuroscience+meets+eating+disorders&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2014-05-06&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-45271-001&rft_id=info:doi/","2500:Physiological Psychology & Neuroscience; allocentric lock; article; autobiographical memory; body image; body shame; Clinical Psychology; cognitive neuroscience; Cognitive Neuroscience; Eating Behavior; eating disorders; Eating Disorders; episodic memory; Human; image schema; Long Term Memory",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The DMN, a network that becomes active at rest when there is no external stimulation or task to perform, has been implicated in self-reflective awareness and prospection. By contrast, the AI is associated with awareness and task-related attention. This has led to competing theories stressing the role of the DMN in self-awareness vs. the role of interoceptive and emotional information integration in the AI in awareness of the emotional moment. In PARCS, the respective functions of the DMN and AI in a specific control system explains their association with different qualities of awareness, and how mental states can shift from one state (e.g., prospective self-reflection) to the other (e.g., awareness of the emotional moment) depending on the relative dominance of control systems. These shifts between reactive and predictive control are part of processes that enable the intake of novel information, integration of this novel information within existing knowledge structures, and the creation of a continuous personal context in which novel information can be integrated and understood. As such, PARCS can explain key characteristics of mental states, such as their temporal and spatial focus (e.g., a focus on the here and now vs. the future; a first person vs. a third person perspective). PARCS further relates mental states to brain states and functions, such as activation of the DMN or hemispheric asymmetry in frontal cortical functions. Together, PARCS deepens the understanding of a broad range of mental states, including mindfulness, mind wandering, rumination, autobiographical memory, imagery, and the experience of self.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:15","2018-06-19 10:19:03",NA,"429",NA,"","5",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1534095794; 24904455",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Internally+directed+cognition+and+mindfulness%3A+An+integrative+perspective+derived+from+predictive+and+reactive+control+systems+theory&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2014-05-20&volume=5&issue=&spage=&au=Tops%2C+Mattie%3BBoksem%2C+Maarten+A.+S.%3BQuirin%2C+Markus%3BIJzerman%2C+Hans%3BKoole%2C+Sander+L.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-39391-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1627945481?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033157/pdf/fpsyg-05-00429.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Internally+directed+cognition+and+mindfulness%3A+an+integrative+perspective+derived+from+predictive+and+reactive+control+systems+theory.&title=Frontiers+in+psychology&issn=16641078&date=2014-01-01&volume=5&issue=&spage=429&au=Tops%2C+Mattie%3BBoksem%2C+Maarten+A+S%3BQuirin%2C+Markus%3BIJzerman%2C+Hans%3BKoole%2C+Sander+L&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24904455&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffpsyg.2014.00429; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Internally+directed+cognition+and+mindfulness%3A+An+integrative+perspective+derived+from+predictive+and+reactive+control+systems+theory&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2014-05-20&volume=5&issue=&spage=&au=Tops%2C+Mattie%3BBoksem%2C+Maarten+A.+S.%3BQuirin%2C+Markus%3BIJzerman%2C+Hans%3BKoole%2C+Sander+L.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-39391-001&rft_id=info:doi/","2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; article; Biological Neural Networks; Cognition; default mode network; Human; imagery; Imagery; insula; Insula; mindfulness; Mindfulness; Neuropsychology; observer perspective; prospection; rumination; Rumination (Cognitive Process); self-reflection; Systems Theory",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A total of 24 upper-limb amputees recalled two autobiographical memories--an amputation-related memory and a recent memory--and rated the phenomenological qualities of each memory, including Vividness, Coherence, Emotional Intensity, Visual Perspective, and Distancing. Participants also completed self-rated measures of psychological distress and personality. The sample was generally well adjusted; participants showed no relevant symptoms of anxiety and depression, and personality scores were similar to the general population. There were no significant differences in phenomenology between the two types of memories recalled. Even though amputation-related memories were, on average, almost 20 years older than the recent memories, they retained their intense phenomenology. Despite the intensity of the memory, none of the phenomenological dimensions were associated with psychological distress. It is worth to further define which dimensions of phenomenology characterize memories of traumatic events, and their association with individuals' psychological reactions.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:17","2018-06-19 10:14:24",NA,"1",NA,"6","9",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1535624015; 24924483",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Autobiographical+memory+and+psychological+distress+in+a+sample+of+upper-limb+amputees.&title=PloS+one&issn=1932-6203&date=2014-01-01&volume=9&issue=6&spage=e99803&au=Luchetti%2C+Martina%3BMontebarocci%2C+Ornella%3BRossi%2C+Nicolino%3BCutti%2C+Andrea+G%3BSutin%2C+Angelina+R&isbn=&jtitle=PloS+one&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24924483&rft_id=info:doi/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099803; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1535624015?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Autobiographical+memory+and+psychological+distress+in+a+sample+of+upper-limb+amputees.&title=PloS+one&issn=1932-6203&date=2014-01-01&volume=9&issue=6&spage=e99803&au=Luchetti%2C+Martina%3BMontebarocci%2C+Ornella%3BRossi%2C+Nicolino%3BCutti%2C+Andrea+G%3BSutin%2C+Angelina+R&isbn=&jtitle=PloS+one&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24924483&rft_id=info:doi/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099803","*Memory, Episodic; *Self Concept; *Stress, Psychological/epidemiology/etiology; Adaptation, Psychological -- physiology; Adaptation, Psychological/physiology; Adult; Aged; Amputees -- psychology; Amputees/*psychology; Anxiety -- epidemiology; Anxiety -- psychology; Anxiety/epidemiology/psychology; Depression -- epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Index Medicus; Life Change Events; Male; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Self Concept; Stress, Psychological -- epidemiology; Stress, Psychological -- etiology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Upper Extremity -- surgery; Upper Extremity/*surgery; Young Adult",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Next, we briefly look at working memory, a domain-general ability whose evolution was central in furthering advanced forms of human cognition and problem solving. The remainder of the chapter looks at possible ontogenetic adaptations of memoryâ€”characteristics of infant and childhood memory that may have been selected to adapt children to the niche of childhood. We begin with adaptations of infancy (the role of context dependency and face recognition), and then discuss how young children's egocentric life view may benefit their memory and the potentially adaptive benefit of young children's enhanced suggestibility.

The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is anatomically positioned between limbic areas important for memory formation, such as the hippocampus (HPC) and the anterior thalamus, and cortical regions along the dorsal stream known to contribute importantly to long-term spatial representation, such as the posterior parietal cortex. Damage to the RSC severely impairs allocentric representations of the environment, including the ability to derive navigational information from landmarks. The specific deficits seen in tests of human and rodent navigation suggest that the RSC supports allocentric representation by processing the stable features of the environment and the spatial relationships among them. In addition to spatial cognition, the RSC plays a key role in contextual and episodic memory. The RSC also contributes importantly to the acquisition and consolidation of long-term spatial and contextual memory through its interactions with the HPC. Within this framework, the RSC plays a dual role as part of the feedforward network providing sensory and mnemonic input to the HPC and as a target of the hippocampal-dependent systems consolidation of long-term memory.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:20","2018-06-19 10:15:12",NA,"586",NA,"","8",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1555247762; 25140141",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Cues%2C+context%2C+and+long-term+memory%3A+The+role+of+the+retrosplenial+cortex+in+spatial+cognition&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2014-08-05&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Miller%2C+Adam+M.+P.%3BVedder%2C+Lindsey+C.%3BLaw%2C+L.+Matthew%3BSmith%2C+David+M.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-52568-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1653146172?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4122222/pdf/fnhum-08-00586.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Cues%2C+context%2C+and+long-term+memory%3A+the+role+of+the+retrosplenial+cortex+in+spatial+cognition.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2014-01-01&volume=8&issue=&spage=586&au=Miller%2C+Adam+M+P%3BVedder%2C+Lindsey+C%3BLaw%2C+L+Matthew%3BSmith%2C+David+M&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/25140141&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2014.00586; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Cues%2C+context%2C+and+long-term+memory%3A+The+role+of+the+retrosplenial+cortex+in+spatial+cognition&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2014-08-05&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Miller%2C+Adam+M.+P.%3BVedder%2C+Lindsey+C.%3BLaw%2C+L.+Matthew%3BSmith%2C+David+M.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-52568-001&rft_id=info:doi/","2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; allocentric; article; Cerebral Cortex; Cognition; consolidation; context; Cues; hippocampus; Hippocampus; Human; learning; Long Term Memory; long-term memory; Memory Consolidation; navigation; retrosplenial cortex; Spatial Ability",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ability to do this depends on learning and remembering locations. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues and nearby proximal cues, egocentric navigation. Allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures; in humans this system encodes allocentric, semantic, and episodic memory. This form of memory is assessed in laboratory animals in many ways, but the dominant form of assessment is the Morris water maze (MWM). Egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and, when overlearned, becomes procedural memory. In this article, several allocentric assessment methods for rodents are reviewed and compared with the MWM. MWM advantages (little training required, no food deprivation, ease of testing, rapid and reliable learning, insensitivity to differences in body weight and appetite, absence of nonperformers, control methods for proximal cue learning, and performance effects) and disadvantages (concern about stress, perhaps not as sensitive for working memory) are discussed. Evidence-based design improvements and testing methods are reviewed for both rats and mice. Experimental factors that apply generally to spatial navigation and to MWM specifically are considered. It is concluded that, on balance, the MWM has more advantages than disadvantages and compares favorably with other allocentric navigation tasks.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:22","2018-06-19 10:19:39",NA,"310-332",NA,"2","55",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1562661990; 25225309",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Assessing+spatial+learning+and+memory+in+rodents.&title=ILAR+journal&issn=1930-6180&date=2014-01-01&volume=55&issue=2&spage=310&au=Vorhees%2C+Charles+V%3BWilliams%2C+Michael+T&isbn=&jtitle=ILAR+journal&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/25225309&rft_id=info:doi/10.1093%2Filar%2Filu013; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562661990?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Assessing+spatial+learning+and+memory+in+rodents.&title=ILAR+journal&issn=1930-6180&date=2014-01-01&volume=55&issue=2&spage=310&au=Vorhees%2C+Charles+V%3BWilliams%2C+Michael+T&isbn=&jtitle=ILAR+journal&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/25225309&rft_id=info:doi/10.1093%2Filar%2Filu013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4240437/pdf/ilu013.pdf","*Cues; Animals; Brain -- physiology; Brain/*physiology; Cues; Index Medicus; Maze Learning -- physiology; Maze Learning/physiology; Memory -- physiology; Memory/*physiology; Mice; Orientation -- physiology; Orientation/*physiology; Rats; Spatial Learning -- physiology; Spatial Learning/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, some of the underlying functions of the MTL can be ascertained from its wider role in supporting spatial cognition in concert with parietal and prefrontal regions. The MTL is strongly implicated in the formation of enduring allocentric representations (e.g., O'Keefe, 1976; King et al., 2002; Ekstrom et al., 2003). According to our BBB model (Byrne et al., 2007), these representations must interact with head-centered and body-centered representations in posterior parietal cortex via a transformation circuit involving retrosplenial areas. Egocentric sensory representations in parietal areas can then cue the recall of allocentric spatial representations in long-term memory and, conversely, the products of retrieval in MTL can generate mental imagery within a parietal ""window."" Such imagery is necessarily egocentric and forms part of visuospatial working memory, in which it can be manipulated for the purpose of planning/imagining the future. Recent fMRI evidence (Lambrey et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) supports the BBB model. To further test the model, we had participants learn the locations of objects in a virtual scene and tested their spatial memory under conditions that impose varying demands on the transformation circuit. We analyzed how brain activity correlated with accuracy in judging the direction of an object (1) from visuospatial working memory (we assume transient working memory due to the order of tasks and the absence of change in viewpoint, but long-term memory retrieval is also possible), (2) after a rotation of viewpoint, or (3) after a rotation and translation of viewpoint (judgment of relative direction). We found performance-related activity in both tasks requiring viewpoint rotation (ROT and JRD, i.e., conditions 2 and 3) in the core medial temporal to medial parietal circuit identified by the BBB model. These results are consistent with the predictions of the BBB model, and shed further light on the neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory, mental imagery and viewpoint transformations.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:23","2018-06-18 12:33:51",NA,"709",NA,"","8",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1586103801; 25278860",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Examining+the+role+of+the+temporo-parietal+network+in+memory%2C+imagery%2C+and+viewpoint+transformations&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2014-09-16&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Dhindsa%2C+Kiret%3BDrobinin%2C+Vladislav%3BKing%2C+John%3BHall%2C+Geoffrey+B.%3BBurgess%2C+Neil%3BBecker%2C+Suzanna&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2015-09920-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687041221?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Examining+the+role+of+the+temporo-parietal+network+in+memory%2C+imagery%2C+and+viewpoint+transformations.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2014-01-01&volume=8&issue=&spage=709&au=Dhindsa%2C+Kiret%3BDrobinin%2C+Vladislav%3BKing%2C+John%3BHall%2C+Geoffrey+B%3BBurgess%2C+Neil%3BBecker%2C+Suzanna&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/25278860&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2014.00709; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Examining+the+role+of+the+temporo-parietal+network+in+memory%2C+imagery%2C+and+viewpoint+transformations&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2014-09-16&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Dhindsa%2C+Kiret%3BDrobinin%2C+Vladislav%3BKing%2C+John%3BHall%2C+Geoffrey+B.%3BBurgess%2C+Neil%3BBecker%2C+Suzanna&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2015-09920-001&rft_id=info:doi/","Male; Human; fMRI; Hippocampus; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory; Cognition; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Canada; Quantitative Study; hippocampus; navigation; Biological Neural Networks; spatial cognition; learning",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The scenes I create are snapshots of stories whose roots are based in my own memories. These pieces from my mind are usually partial and fleeting, recalled as if viewing my own life from a third person perspective. Primarily through the use of advanced methods in kiln forming glass, the work will create a three dimensional illustration of these experiences.  The Art of Reconstruction: I think about life, what I am making, and why I am making it. I look back to the past as well as where I am, and the people I have let in or out of my life. The lines separating the actual events blur; the real and the imagined become one memory and, at times, the reality of a situation gives way to a metaphor created to convey what I am feeling while removing the personal experience. This neutrality allows me the opportunity to focus on what happened internally and how that has taken an effect on me. To simplify, the objective of my MFA Thesis body of work is to tell a story whose roots are based in a personal reality, yet stands before the viewer as an ambiguous, fantastical narrative.    It is my intention to create pages from made up stories depicting moments from the life or adventures of a girl. Watching her placed again and again in situations without being aware of how she got there, how she dealt with them, not knowing if she conquered the problem she is presented with, or if it defeated her gives the viewer the option to become more invested in the girlâ€™s story. They are given the opportunity to finish her story in their own minds. By removing many of the direct references to time, place, or my personal experiences from the visual context leaves a vague scenario; an objective situation is provided to consider. I am creating a tangible representation of the intangible sentiments of human emotion and personal memory.    These pieces are representational of the world as I see it â€¦as I remember it through my distorted eyes and years. It is important to me that the girl â€“ while she is most likely the same girl and most likely me â€“ has an ambiguous age. She is child and adult at the same time. This agelessness, this uncertainty of her age, speaks to the years that some of the emotions and memories I am referencing span. I see my hands as huge, my wrists as long and skinny, waist as nonexistent and hips prominent. The physical attributes are not vain; they are simply a select few distorted versions of me that I see when I reflect upon my life.    The events that I choose to represent have no environment. I see the environment as something that ties the experience to my specific memories and life. By removing details of the specific time and place I am not only able to relate to various moments from my own past, but also allow the viewer more freedom to fill in the gaps with their own personal narratives. When I recall events I recall multiple events at a time: memories similar in their nature, their emotion and in their content. Yet I find their landscape to be geographically so different, years and time zones apart. I find myself represented as a child, a teenager and a grown woman all at once. Perhaps the scenes will have a detailed environment but the others exist in no specific time. The ones that seem to span the years, the repetitious moments I find myself reliving again and again. These are the instants that will live in an invisible, nonexistent place in my mind; a space unconstrained with the details of geography and focused on the repeat events. It is a cycle I seemed doomed to repeat for eternity. There will always be light, but the night will always follow.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:25","2018-06-19 10:19:30",NA,"",15,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Rochester Institute of Technology","Ann Arbor","English","","M.F.A.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1608998840",NA,NA,"1563415",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Reconstructed+Memories&issn=&date=2014-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Vaughn%2C+Sarah&isbn=9781321125313&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1608998840?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Reconstructed+Memories&issn=&date=2014-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Vaughn%2C+Sarah&isbn=9781321125313&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","0357:Fine arts; 0591:American literature; American literature; Casting; Communication and the arts; Figurative; Fine arts; Glass; Language, literature and linguistics; Memory; Narrative; Original writing; Story-telling",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often report mood disturbances and past traumatic experiences, it would be plausible to expect that these patients too would retrieve higher proportions of observer memories. Therefore, and given the phenotypical variance of BPD, we examined whether vantage perspective during recall is associated with one or more BPD symptom clusters.METHODSA community sample consisting of 148 volunteers (66 males) completed the Autobiographical Memory Test, the Borderline Syndrome Index, and the Depression Scale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.RESULTSInterpersonal and anxious-neurotic BPD features were associated with higher proportions of observer memories.CONCLUSIONSThe proportion of observer memories was not associated with the total number of BPD symptoms. Nevertheless, our data suggest the existence of substantial connections between perspective taking during recall on the one hand and interpersonal difficulties and anxious-neurotic symptoms on the other hand, especially following cues that tap into domains that are highly discrepant towards one's actual self-concept.","2014","2018-06-18 10:55:27","2018-06-19 10:19:24",NA,"8",NA,"","1",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1716936116; 26401292",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+relationship+between+borderline+symptoms+and+vantage+perspective+during+autobiographical+memory+retrieval+in+a+community+sample.&title=Borderline+personality+disorder+and+emotion+dysregulation&issn=20516673&date=2014-01-01&volume=1&issue=&spage=8&au=Van+den+Broeck%2C+Kris%3BReza%2C+Jasmin%3BNelis%2C+Sabine%3BClaes%2C+Laurence%3BPieters%2C+Guido%3BRaes%2C+Filip&isbn=&jtitle=Borderline+personality+disorder+and+emotion+dysregulation&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/26401292&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2F2051-6673-1-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579497/pdf/40479_2013_Article_8.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1716936116?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+relationship+between+borderline+symptoms+and+vantage+perspective+during+autobiographical+memory+retrieval+in+a+community+sample.&title=Borderline+personality+disorder+and+emotion+dysregulation&issn=20516673&date=2014-01-01&volume=1&issue=&spage=8&au=Van+den+Broeck%2C+Kris%3BReza%2C+Jasmin%3BNelis%2C+Sabine%3BClaes%2C+Laurence%3BPieters%2C+Guido%3BRaes%2C+Filip&isbn=&jtitle=Borderline+personality+disorder+and+emotion+dysregulation&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/26401292&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2F2051-6673-1-8","Autobiographical memory; Borderline personality disorder; Imagery perspective; Self-discrepancy; Vantage perspective",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, few studies investigated the neurochemical mechanisms that mediate the prefrontal retrieval process. In the current study, we examined whether N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the mPFC were necessary for retrieval of a well-learned spatial location on the basis of partial or degraded spatial cues. Rats were initially trained to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze using four extramaze cues in the surrounding environment. Their retrieval performance was subsequently tested under different cue conditions. Infusions of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a NMDAR antagonist, significantly disrupted memory retrieval when three of the original cues were removed. By contrast, APV injections into the mPFC did not affect animals' retrieval performance when the original cues were presented or when three novels landmarks were added alongside the original cues. These results indicate that prefrontal NMDARs are required for memory retrieval when allocentric spatial information is degraded. NMDAR-dependent neurotransmission in the mPFC may facilitate an active retrieval process to reactivate complete contextual representations associated with partial retrieval cues.","2014-03","2018-06-18 10:55:30","2018-06-18 12:38:23",NA,"20-26",NA,"","109",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1502332168; 24269352",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1074742713002219/1-s2.0-S1074742713002219-main.pdf?_tid=04f9e5c2-4b08-40f0-ab4c-5bb6afaee63b&acdnat=1529061529_d0ffbf34642daef843b00444f88b99e1; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Memory+retrieval+in+response+to+partial+cues+requires+NMDA+receptor-dependent+neurotransmission+in+the+medial+prefrontal+cortex.&title=Neurobiology+of+learning+and+memory&issn=1095-9564&date=2014-03-01&volume=109&issue=&spage=20&au=Jo%2C+Yong+Sang%3BChoi%2C+June-Seek&isbn=&jtitle=Neurobiology+of+learning+and+memory&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24269352&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.nlm.2013.11.004; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1502332168?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Memory+retrieval+in+response+to+partial+cues+requires+NMDA+receptor-dependent+neurotransmission+in+the+medial+prefrontal+cortex.&title=Neurobiology+of+learning+and+memory&issn=1095-9564&date=2014-03-01&volume=109&issue=&spage=20&au=Jo%2C+Yong+Sang%3BChoi%2C+June-Seek&isbn=&jtitle=Neurobiology+of+learning+and+memory&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24269352&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.nlm.2013.11.004; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Memory+retrieval+in+response+to+partial+cues+requires+NMDA+receptor-dependent+neurotransmission+in+the+medial+prefrontal+cortex&title=Neurobiology+of+Learning+and+Memory&issn=10747427&date=2014-03-01&volume=109&issue=&spage=20&au=Jo%2C+Yong+Sang%3BChoi%2C+June-Seek&isbn=&jtitle=Neurobiology+of+Learning+and+Memory&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-07515-004&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.nlm.2013.11.004","Male; Cues; Memory; article; Empirical Study; Mental Recall; Index Medicus; 0; 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate; 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate -- pharmacology; 76726-92-6; Animals; Rats; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate -- antagonists & inhibitors; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate -- physiology; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Animal; Maze Learning; N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Maze Learning -- physiology; Mental Recall -- physiology; Quantitative Study; memory retrieval; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; Synaptic Transmission; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists -- pharmacology; Synaptic Transmission -- drug effects; Synaptic Transmission -- physiology; Spatial memory; Prefrontal Cortex; rats; Neural Receptors; Maze Learning -- drug effects; Memory retrieval; Mental Recall -- drug effects; NMDA receptors; Prefrontal cortex; Prefrontal Cortex -- drug effects; Prefrontal Cortex -- physiology; Rat; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; medial prefrontal cortex; neurotransmission; Neurotransmission; partial cues; *Cues; 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate/pharmacology; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology; Maze Learning/drug effects/physiology; Mental Recall/drug effects/*physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/drug effects/*physiology; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology; Synaptic Transmission/drug effects/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This link has been supported by clinical reports of long-term episodic memory impairments in psychiatric conditions with dissociative symptoms, in which individuals feel detached from themselves as if having an out-of-body experience. Here, we introduce an experimental approach to examine the necessary role of perceiving the world from the perspective of one's own body for the successful episodic encoding of real-life events. While participants were involved in a social interaction, an out-of-body illusion was elicited, in which the sense of bodily self was displaced from the real body to the other end of the testing room. This condition was compared with a well-matched in-body illusion condition, in which the sense of bodily self was colocalized with the real body. In separate recall sessions, performed âˆ¼1 wk later, we assessed the participants' episodic memory of these events. The results revealed an episodic recollection deficit for events encoded out-of-body compared with in-body. Functional magnetic resonance imaging indicated that this impairment was specifically associated with activity changes in the posterior hippocampus. Collectively, these findings show that efficient hippocampus-based episodic-memory encoding requires a first-person perspective of the natural spatial relationship between the body and the world. Our observations have important implications for theoretical models of episodic memory, neurocognitive models of self, embodied cognition, and clinical research into memory deficits in psychiatric disorders.","2014-03-25","2018-06-18 10:55:38","2018-06-18 12:29:07",NA,"4421-4426",NA,"12","111",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1514433980; 24616529",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Out-of-body-induced+hippocampal+amnesia.&title=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&issn=1091-6490&date=2014-03-25&volume=111&issue=12&spage=4421&au=Bergouignan%2C+Loretxu%3BNyberg%2C+Lars%3BEhrsson%2C+H+Henrik&isbn=&jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24616529&rft_id=info:doi/10.1073%2Fpnas.1318801111; http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/12/4421.full.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1514433980?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Out-of-body-induced+hippocampal+amnesia.&title=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&issn=1091-6490&date=2014-03-25&volume=111&issue=12&spage=4421&au=Bergouignan%2C+Loretxu%3BNyberg%2C+Lars%3BEhrsson%2C+H+Henrik&isbn=&jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24616529&rft_id=info:doi/10.1073%2Fpnas.1318801111; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Out-of-body%E2%80%93induced+hippocampal+amnesia&title=PNAS+Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&issn=00278424&date=2014-03-25&volume=111&issue=12&spage=4421&au=Bergouignan%2C+Loretxu%3BNyberg%2C+Lars%3BEhrsson%2C+H.+Henrik&isbn=&jtitle=PNAS+Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-11429-004&rft_id=info:doi/10.1073%2Fpnas.1318801111","Humans; Models, Psychological; Human; Episodic Memory; Amnesia; Hippocampus; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; episodic memory; autobiographical memory; body illusion; dissociative experience; self-consciousness; article; Empirical Study; Self-Perception; Autobiographical Memory; Index Medicus; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus -- physiopathology; Quantitative Study; hippocampal amnesia; self consciousness; Life Change Events; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Brain Imaging; Interview; out of body experience; Out of Body Experiences; *Amnesia; Hippocampus/*physiopathology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is ample neurophysiological evidence that the MTL computes location in allocentric space and more recent evidence that the MTL also codes for time. Space and time represent a similar computational challenge; both are variables that cannot be simply calculated from the immediately available sensory information. We introduce a simple mathematical framework that computes functions of both spatial location and time as special cases of a more general computation. In this framework, experience unfolding in time is encoded via a set of leaky integrators. These leaky integrators encode the Laplace transform of their input. The information contained in the transform can be recovered using an approximation to the inverse Laplace transform. In the temporal domain, the resulting representation reconstructs the temporal history. By integrating movements, the equations give rise to a representation of the path taken to arrive at the present location. By modulating the transform with information about allocentric velocity, the equations code for position of a landmark. Simulated cells show a close correspondence to neurons observed in various regions for all three cases. In the temporal domain, novel secondary analyses of hippocampal time cells verified several qualitative predictions of the model. An integrated representation of spatiotemporal context can be computed by taking conjunctions of these elemental inputs, leading to a correspondence with conjunctive neural representations observed in dorsal CA1.","2014-03-26","2018-06-18 10:55:41","2018-06-18 12:37:34",NA,"4692-4707",NA,"13","34",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1511395015; 24672015",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=A+unified+mathematical+framework+for+coding+time%2C+space%2C+and+sequences+in+the+hippocampal+region.&title=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&issn=1529-2401&date=2014-03-26&volume=34&issue=13&spage=4692&au=Howard%2C+Marc+W%3BMacDonald%2C+Christopher+J%3BTiganj%2C+Zoran%3BShankar%2C+Karthik+H%3BDu%2C+Qian%3BHasselmo%2C+Michael+E%3BEichenbaum%2C+Howard&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24672015&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.5808-12.2014; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1511395015?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=A+unified+mathematical+framework+for+coding+time%2C+space%2C+and+sequences+in+the+hippocampal+region.&title=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&issn=1529-2401&date=2014-03-26&volume=34&issue=13&spage=4692&au=Howard%2C+Marc+W%3BMacDonald%2C+Christopher+J%3BTiganj%2C+Zoran%3BShankar%2C+Karthik+H%3BDu%2C+Qian%3BHasselmo%2C+Michael+E%3BEichenbaum%2C+Howard&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24672015&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.5808-12.2014; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=A+unified+mathematical+framework+for+coding+time%2C+space%2C+and+sequences+in+the+hippocampal+region&title=The+Journal+of+Neuroscience&issn=02706474&date=2014-03-26&volume=34&issue=13&spage=4692&au=Howard%2C+Marc+W.%3BMacDonald%2C+Christopher+J.%3BTiganj%2C+Zoran%3BShankar%2C+Karthik+H.%3BDu%2C+Qian%3BHasselmo%2C+Michael+E.%3BEichenbaum%2C+Howard&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-11310-019&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.5808-12.2014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3965792/pdf/zns4692.pdf","Episodic Memory; Hippocampus; episodic memory; article; Empirical Study; Time Factors; Index Medicus; Hippocampus -- physiology; Animals; Rats; Hippocampus -- cytology; Neurons -- physiology; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Animal; Neurons; Space Perception; Space Perception -- physiology; Temporal Lobe; Models, Neurological; Quantitative Study; Computer Simulation; hippocampus; Action Potentials; Neurophysiology; place cells; temporal lobe; entorhinal cortex; Mathematics; spatiotemporal context; subiculum; time cells; hippocampal region; mathematical framework; Mathematical Model; neurophysiological evidence; Space Perception/*physiology; *Computer Simulation; *Mathematics; *Models, Neurological; Hippocampus/*cytology/physiology; Neurons/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As stimuli, moral dilemmas or moral statements/ pictures that induce emotional reactions are usually employed; a main difference between these stimuli is the perspective of the participants reflecting first-person (moral dilemmas) or third-person perspective (moral reactions). The present study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to investigate the neural correlates of moral judgments in either first- or third-person perspective.RESULTSOur results indicate that different neural mechanisms appear to be involved in these perspectives. Although conjunction analysis revealed common activation in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, third person-perspective elicited unique activations in hippocampus and visual cortex. The common activation can be explained by the role the anterior medial prefrontal cortex may play in integrating different information types and also by its involvement in theory of mind. Our results also indicate that the so-called ""actor-observer bias"" affects moral evaluation in the third-person perspective, possibly due to the involvement of the hippocampus. We suggest two possible ways in which the hippocampus may support the process of moral judgment: by the engagement of episodic memory and its role in understanding the behaviors and emotions of others.CONCLUSIONWe posit that these findings demonstrate that first or third person perspectives in moral cognition involve distinct neural processes, that are important to different aspects of moral judgments. These results are important to a deepened understanding of neural correlates of moral cognition-the so-called ""first tradition"" of neuroethics, with the caveat that any results must be interpreted and employed with prudence, so as to heed neuroethics ""second tradition"" that sustains the pragmatic evaluation of outcomes, capabilities and limitations of neuroscientific techniques and technologies.","2014-04-01","2018-06-18 10:55:45","2018-06-18 12:26:17",NA,"39",NA,"","15",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1517880075; 24742205",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Neural+correlates+of+moral+judgments+in+first-+and+third-person+perspectives%3A+Implications+for+neuroethics+and+beyond&title=BMC+Neuroscience&issn=1471-2202&date=2014-04-01&volume=15&issue=&spage=&au=Avram%2C+Mihai%3BHennig-Fast%2C+Kristina%3BBao%2C+Yan%3BP%C3%B6ppel%2C+Ernst%3BReiser%2C+Maximilian%3BBlautzik%2C+Janusch%3BGiordano%2C+James%3BGutyrchik%2C+Evgeny&isbn=&jtitle=BMC+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-31990-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991864/pdf/1471-2202-15-39.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1560816311?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Neural+correlates+of+moral+judgments+in+first-+and+third-person+perspectives%3A+implications+for+neuroethics+and+beyond.&title=BMC+neuroscience&issn=1471-2202&date=2014-04-01&volume=15&issue=&spage=39&au=Avram%2C+Mihai%3BHennig-Fast%2C+Kristina%3BBao%2C+Yan%3BP%C3%B6ppel%2C+Ernst%3BReiser%2C+Maximilian%3BBlautzik%2C+Janusch%3BGiordano%2C+James%3BGutyrchik%2C+Evgeny&isbn=&jtitle=BMC+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24742205&rft_id=info:doi/10.1186%2F1471-2202-15-39; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Neural+correlates+of+moral+judgments+in+first-+and+third-person+perspectives%3A+Implications+for+neuroethics+and+beyond&title=BMC+Neuroscience&issn=1471-2202&date=2014-04-01&volume=15&issue=&spage=&au=Avram%2C+Mihai%3BHennig-Fast%2C+Kristina%3BBao%2C+Yan%3BP%C3%B6ppel%2C+Ernst%3BReiser%2C+Maximilian%3BBlautzik%2C+Janusch%3BGiordano%2C+James%3BGutyrchik%2C+Evgeny&isbn=&jtitle=BMC+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-31990-001&rft_id=info:doi/","Adult; Humans; Male; Emotions; Human; fMRI; Hippocampus; prefrontal cortex; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Index Medicus; Brain Mapping; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Judgment; Quantitative Study; Germany; Brain Mapping -- methods; Brain; Brain -- physiology; hippocampus; Judgment -- physiology; Emotions -- physiology; Prefrontal Cortex; Neural Pathways; Role Taking; Brain Imaging; perspective; theory of mind; Theory of Mind; Artifacts; Morals; Retrospective Moral Judgment; Bioethics; moral judgment; Morality; neural correlates; neuroethics; Emotions/*physiology; Brain/*physiology; *Artifacts; *Morals; Brain Mapping/*methods; Judgment/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite evidence of a relation between prospection and episodic memory, there is a paucity of research comparing the developmental trajectories of each during middle childhood, a time of substantial episodic memory development. This study examined prospection and episodic memory in 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old children and adults (N =80). Participants provided narratives and introspective judgments about their experience of mentalizing past and future events. The development of prospection was more protracted than that of episodic memory, although individual differences in past event episodicity predicted prospection. Although both prospection and episodic memory were characterized by a rich subjective experience, future events were rated as more difficult to envision and were more frequently viewed in the third-person perspective. Although both prospection and episodic memory appear to improve during middle childhood, results suggest that prospection may require additional skills.

However, its neural underpinnings remain mostly unexplored. Visual perspective during AM retrieval was assessed in two independent datasets of 45 and 20 healthy young adults with two different AM retrieval tasks. Diffeomorphic anatomical registration using exponentiated lie algebra and voxel-based morphometry were used to assess individual differences in the precuneus grey matter volume. The spontaneous tendency to recall memories from a first-person perspective was positively correlated with the right precuneus volume among the two independent datasets. Whole-brain analyses revealed that these results were relatively specific to the anterior part of the right precuneus. Our results provide first evidence for the role of the precuneus in egocentric spatial processing in the context of AM retrieval among healthy subjects.

The lifeline tool in Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is an effective first step towards discussing the traumatic material. The lifeline in NET displays the emotional highlights of the personâ€™s life in a symbolic way. Looking at oneâ€™s autobiography from an allocentric perspective can serve as a controlled contact to the fragmented memories. This is then followed by a well-directed imaginal exposure from which a chronological narrative emerges.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2010-07896-009.) Objective: Enhanced understanding of cognitive deficits, and the neurobiological abnormalities that mediate them, can be achieved through translational research that employs comparable experimental approaches across species. This study employed a multiple-systems framework derived from the rodent literature to investigate visualâ€“spatial memory abilities associated with schizophrenia. Method: Using the bin task, a human analog of rodent maze tasks, everyday objects were hidden in visually identical bins. Following a 1-min filled delay, participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders ( n = 30) and healthy community controls ( n = 30) were asked to identify both the object hidden and bin used on the basis of its spatial location. Three dimensions of visualâ€“spatial memory were contrasted: (a) memory for spatial locations versus memory for objects, (b) allocentric (viewpoint independent) versus egocentric (body-centered) spatial representations, and (c) event (working) memory versus reference memory. Results: Most pronounced was a differential deficit in memory for spatial locations under allocentric ( p = .005, d = âˆ’0.77) but not egocentric viewing conditions ( p = .298, d = âˆ’0.28) in the schizophrenia group relative to healthy controls. Similarly, schizophrenia-related spatial memory deficits were pronounced under demands for event memory ( p = .004, d = âˆ’0.77) but not reference memory ( p = .171, d = âˆ’0.33). Conclusions: These results support a heuristic of preferential deficits in hippocampal-mediated forms of memory in schizophrenia. Moreover, the task provides a useful paradigm for translational research and the pattern of deficits suggests that persons with schizophrenia may benefit from mnemonic approaches favoring egocentric representations and consistency when interacting with our visualâ€“spatial world.

This suggests three ideas: that episodic memory offers us access to the past that is quasi-experiential, that it is a source of knowledge of the past, and that it is, at root, passive. I offer an account of episodic memory that rejects all three ideas. The account claims that remembering is a matter of representing the past to oneself, in a way suitably responsive to how one experienced the remembered episode to be. I argue that episodic memory is active, in the way this view suggests. I clarify the idea that it is, as the view also implies, not a source of knowledge but an expression of knowledge the subject already has. And I suggest the view need not limit memories to states that are in any way experience-like. This position offers a way to articulate the relations between episodic memory and related phenomena: factual memory, generic memory, remembering-how and anticipation. And it allows us to explain how we know which aspects of our episodic memory states to take seriously and which (such as the shift to an observer perspective on the remembered events) to treat as merely incidental.

The idea is that re-experiential memory will â€œinheritâ€ these spatiotemporal features. On the basis of this assumption, Russell and Hanna ( Mind and Language 27(1):29â€“54, 2012) proposed that (a) the spatial element of re-experience is egocentric and (b) that the temporal element of re-experiencing involves order/simultaneity. The first of these assumptions is immediately problematic for two reasons. In the first place, if we assume that early episodic recall mediated by processing in the hippocampus, then (a) is clearly in tension with the fact that spatial coding in the hippocampus is allocentric/environment-centred. Second, two of our own recent experiments (described here) show that when only egocentric cues are available in a What/When/Where episodic memory task it is not possible to distinguish young childrenâ€™s performance from semantic memory. I argue that this tension should be resolved by recognising that the egocentric coding of the original experience as being of an objective scene relies upon allocentric representations and these are preserved in re-experiential memory, allowing a recollection of the objective nature of the scene on which one takes a subjective view.

Next, animals of a second group learned in a two-alternative choice paradigm to discriminate between two colours, whereas a third group solved a spatial cognition task in an open-field maze by use of an ego-allocentric strategy. After memory acquisition and consolidation, animals were pharmacologically treated using the treatment regime as in the first group and then tested again for memory retrieval.RESULTSWe found an enhanced Erk but not Akt phosphorylation suggesting that THC treatment specifically activated Erk signalling in the zebrafish telencephalon. While CB1 agonist THC did not affect behavioural performance of animals in the colour discrimination paradigm, spatial memory was significantly impaired. The effect of THC on spatial learning is probably specific, since neither motor activity nor anxiety-related behaviour was influenced by the drug treatment. That indicates a striking influence of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) on spatial cognition in zebrafish.CONCLUSIONSThe results are very coincident with reports on mammals, demonstrating that the ECS is functional highly conserved during vertebrate evolution. We further conclude that the zebrafish provides a promising model organism for ongoing research on the ECS.","2014-10","2018-06-18 10:56:13","2018-06-19 10:17:42",NA,"3829-3842",NA,"19","231",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1561469730; 24639045",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Acute+administration+of+THC+impairs+spatial+but+not+associative+memory+function+in+zebrafish.&title=Psychopharmacology&issn=1432-2072&date=2014-10-01&volume=231&issue=19&spage=3829&au=Ruhl%2C+Tim%3BPrinz%2C+Nicole%3BOellers%2C+Nadine%3BSeidel%2C+Nathan+Ian%3BJonas%2C+Annika%3BAlbayram%2C+Onder%3BBilkei-Gorzo%2C+Andras%3Bvon+der+Emde%2C+Gerhard&isbn=&jtitle=Psychopharmacology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24639045&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00213-014-3522-5; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00213-014-3522-5.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1561469730?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Acute+administration+of+THC+impairs+spatial+but+not+associative+memory+function+in+zebrafish.&title=Psychopharmacology&issn=1432-2072&date=2014-10-01&volume=231&issue=19&spage=3829&au=Ruhl%2C+Tim%3BPrinz%2C+Nicole%3BOellers%2C+Nadine%3BSeidel%2C+Nathan+Ian%3BJonas%2C+Annika%3BAlbayram%2C+Onder%3BBilkei-Gorzo%2C+Andras%3Bvon+der+Emde%2C+Gerhard&isbn=&jtitle=Psychopharmacology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/24639045&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00213-014-3522-5; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Acute+administration+of+THC+impairs+spatial+but+not+associative+memory+function+in+zebrafish&title=Psychopharmacology&issn=00333158&date=2014-10-01&volume=231&issue=19&spage=3829&au=Ruhl%2C+Tim%3BPrinz%2C+Nicole%3BOellers%2C+Nadine%3BSeidel%2C+Nathan+Ian%3BJonas%2C+Annika%3BAlbayram%2C+%C3%96nder%3BBilkei-Gorzo%2C+Andras%3Bvon+der+Emde%2C+Gerhard&isbn=&jtitle=Psychopharmacology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-38153-002&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00213-014-3522-5","0; 2580:Psychopharmacology; 7J8897W37S; Animal; Animals; article; Brain; Brain -- drug effects; Brain -- metabolism; Brain/drug effects/metabolism; Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists; Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists -- metabolism; Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists -- pharmacology; Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists/metabolism/*pharmacology; Cognition; Cognition -- drug effects; Cognition -- physiology; Cognition/drug effects/physiology; Dronabinol; Dronabinol -- administration & dosage; Dronabinol -- metabolism; Dronabinol/*administration & dosage/metabolism; Drug Therapy; Empirical Study; Endocannabinoid system; Female; Fish; Index Medicus; Learning; Ligand; Male; Maze Learning; Maze Learning -- drug effects; Maze Learning/drug effects; Memory; Memory -- drug effects; Memory -- physiology; Memory/*drug effects/physiology; Motor Processes; Phosphorylation; Photic Stimulation; Photic Stimulation -- methods; Photic Stimulation/methods; Quantitative Study; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1 -- agonists; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1 -- metabolism; Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1/agonists/metabolism; Spatial Behavior; Spatial Behavior -- drug effects; Spatial Behavior -- physiology; Spatial Behavior/*drug effects/physiology; Telencephalon; Tetrahydrocannabinol; Zebrafish",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined this relation across a range of discrete emotions. In Study 1, we found that high worriers compared with low worriers use more observer perspective when remembering and imagining emotional (fear, joy, shame, pride), important, and word-cued events. Across emotional and word-cued events, and for both past and future temporal direction, high worriers reported more observer perspective than low worriers. In Study 2, we examined the use of visual perspective in relation to worry and other measures of negative affect and thinking styles, when remembering events involving positive versus negative evaluation of self versus others (shame, pride, contempt, admiration). We found that measures of general anxiety, symptoms of social anxiety, and rumination were associated with greater observer perspective, whereas reflection was associated with more field perspective. Together, the 2 studies show that high levels of maladaptive thinking and negative affect are associated with using more observer perspective when imagining and remembering autobiographical events across a range of emotions.

Studies of patients with adult-onset lesions lend support to these distinctions for newly encountered places but suggest that with time and/or experience, schematic aspects of environments can exist independent of the hippocampus. Less clear is the quality of spatial memories acquired in individuals with impaired episodic memory in the context of a hippocampal system that did not develop normally. Here we describe a detailed investigation of the integrity of spatial representations of environments navigated repeatedly over many years in the rare case of H.C., a person with congenital absence of the mammillary bodies and abnormal hippocampal and fornix development. H.C. and controls who had extensive experience navigating the residential and downtown areas known to H.C. were tested on mental navigation tasks that assess the identity, location, and spatial relations among landmarks, and the ability to represent routes. H.C. was able to represent distances and directions between familiar landmarks and provide accurate, though inefficient, route descriptions. However, difficulties producing detailed spatial features on maps and accurately ordering more than two landmarks that are in close proximity to one another along a route suggest a spatial representation that includes only coarse, schematic information that lacks coherence and that cannot be used flexibly. This pattern of performance is considered in the context of other areas of preservation and impairment exhibited by H.C. and suggests that the allocentric-egocentric dichotomy with respect to hippocampal and extended hippocampal system function may need to be reconsidered.","2015","2018-06-18 10:56:26","2018-06-19 10:17:31",NA,"196",NA,"","9",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1685745792; 26029074",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Patterns+of+preserved+and+impaired+spatial+memory+in+a+case+of+developmental+amnesia.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2015-01-01&volume=9&issue=&spage=196&au=Rosenbaum%2C+R+Shayna%3BCassidy%2C+Benjamin+N%3BHerdman%2C+Katherine+A&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/26029074&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2015.00196; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685745792?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4426723/pdf/fnhum-09-00196.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Patterns+of+preserved+and+impaired+spatial+memory+in+a+case+of+developmental+amnesia.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2015-01-01&volume=9&issue=&spage=196&au=Rosenbaum%2C+R+Shayna%3BCassidy%2C+Benjamin+N%3BHerdman%2C+Katherine+A&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/26029074&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2015.00196; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Patterns+of+preserved+and+impaired+spatial+memory+in+a+case+of+developmental+amnesia&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2015-05-11&volume=9&issue=&spage=&au=Rosenbaum%2C+R.+Shayna%3BCassidy%2C+Benjamin+N.%3BHerdman%2C+Katherine+A.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2015-33506-001&rft_id=info:doi/","3297:Neurological Disorders & Brain Damage; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Amnesia; article; Brain Imaging; case study; Clinical Case Study; developmental amnesia; Egocentrism; Empirical Study; extended hippocampal system; Female; hippocampus; Hippocampus; Human; landmark recognition; mental navigation; Quantitative Study; spatial learning; Spatial Memory; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs)",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Building on prior research, the current experiment explores two such facets, core and conceptual self, and how these constructs extend to neurocognitive representations of other persons and groups of people.  Core self is a representation of oneself as an individual whose subjective experience is unified within a particular moment.  It includes identification with one's body (body ownership), authorship for one's actions (agency), and an embodied, egocentric point of view (first-person perspective).  Conceptual self is a representation of oneself as an individual whose identity persists through time.  It includes one's personality traits and physical characteristics, and the narrative of one's life constructed from accumulated autobiographical memories.    I conducted an fMRI experiment (N = 19) to determine the neural correlates of core and conceptual representations for the self, other persons, and groups of people. On each trial, participants were presented for three seconds with an individual (the self, a relative, a friend, or an acquaintance), a group (adults or children), or a semantic prompt (physical or genetic). Participants were then presented for three seconds with a property (e.g., tall) and rated how well the property applied to the individual (e.g., how tall is the individual?), group (e.g., how tall are children?), or prompt (e.g., to what extent is tall a genetic property?). The first phase, in which the individual, group, or prompt was presented, was intended to elicit core representations. The second phase, in which the property was presented, was intended to elicit conceptual representations.   The core self condition recruited brain areas associated with body ownership, agency, the first-person perspective, and visuospatial imagery. The conceptual self condition involved these as well, and further implicated brain areas associated with representing personality traits, semantic person knowledge, and executive control of memory retrieval, decision making, and theory-of-mind. Representations for other persons and groups of people rely on these and other systems insofar as the information they provide is relevant to the task at hand, and available with respect to that person or group of people. Some differences between self and other were modulated by the closeness of the personal relationship.","2015","2018-06-18 10:56:27","2018-06-18 12:33:57",NA,"",209,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"Emory University","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1692524872",NA,NA,"3708964",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Neural+Bases+of+Core+and+Conceptual+Self%3A+Implications+for+the+Representation+of+Other+Persons+and+Groups+of+People&issn=&date=2015-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Drucker%2C+Jonathan+Harris&isbn=9781321844245&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1692524872?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Neural+Bases+of+Core+and+Conceptual+Self%3A+Implications+for+the+Representation+of+Other+Persons+and+Groups+of+People&issn=&date=2015-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Drucker%2C+Jonathan+Harris&isbn=9781321844245&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Neural+bases+of+core+and+conceptual+self%3A+Implications+for+the+representation+of+other+persons+and+groups+of+people&issn=&date=2016-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Drucker%2C+Jonathan+Harris&isbn=978-1321844245&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-16234-087&rft_id=info:doi/","Human; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Psychology; autobiographical memory; Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; 2340:Cognitive Processes; Decision Making; Self; Quantitative Study; Brain; 2500:Physiological Psychology & Neuroscience; 0317:Neurosciences; Biological sciences; Neurosciences; brain; 0633:Cognitive psychology; Cognitive psychology; Neuroimaging; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Brain Imaging; Fmri; Grounded cognition; Self-concept; Agency; semantics",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research suggests that individuals with a history of suicidality exhibit over-general autobiographical memories (i.e., lacking in detail; Pollock & Williams, 2001). Over-general memory may be related to a bias towards the observer perspective during memory encoding and recall. This study tested this hypothesis by examining the autobiographical recall perspectives of 107 young adults with and without symptoms of suicidality during task and negative event recall. Compared to controls, those with a history of suicide attempts recalled tasks and the neutral event significantly less from the observer perspective and significantly more from the field perspective; suicide ideators and controls were not significantly different on recall perspectives. No significant differences in negative event recall were found across groups. Results indicated that individuals with a history of suicide attempts exhibited a recall bias towards first person, internally focused memories.

Developmental studies find that perspective tasks are mastered at around 4 years of age. Our first study, meta-analyses of brain imaging studies shows that perspective tasks specifically activate a region in the left IPL and precuneus. These tasks include processing of false belief, visual perspective, and episodic memory. We test the location specificity theory in our second study with an unusual and novel kind of perspective task: identity statements. According to Frege's classical logical analysis, identity statements require appreciation of modes of presentation (perspectives). We show that identity statements, e.g., ""the tour guide is also the driver"" activate the left IPL in contrast to a control statements, ""the tour guide has an apprentice.""

A narrative lie is the deliberate attempt to mislead by telling an imagined narrative as though it actually occurred. According to the theory of reality monitoring, narratives of imagined memories are different than narratives of experienced memories. The present study investigated the language of narrative lies compared to the language of honest memory reports across two visual recall perspectives (first-person and observer).  Participants were asked to tell an experienced and an imagined narrative from the first-person and observer recall perspective. Three algorithms that measure word usage were applied to examine the differences, two using the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) program and one using the Discourse Attributes Analysis Program (DAAP). The results showed a significant bias toward recalling experienced memories from a first-person perspective that was not present for imagined memories. Neither LIWC-based nor DAAP-based algorithms detected narrative source (real or imagined) above chance levels for first-person narratives. When applied to the narratives recalled from the observer perspective, accuracy for all algorithms improved or was unchanged. Narrative source (real or imagined) was most accurately classified by the reality monitoring algorithm utilizing the LIWC software for narratives recalled from the observer perspective, significantly improved over chance and the other algorithms.","2015","2018-06-18 10:56:33","2018-06-18 12:33:54",NA,"",48,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"State University of New York at Buffalo","Ann Arbor","English","","M.A.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1716393531",NA,NA,"1594702",NA,"; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Using+the+Imagined+False+Autobiographical+Memory+Task+to+Examine+the+Language+of+Narrative+Lies&issn=&date=2015-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Dietrich%2C+Sarah&isbn=9781321921144&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Using+the+Imagined+False+Autobiographical+Memory+Task+to+Examine+the+Language+of+Narrative+Lies&issn=&date=2015-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Dietrich%2C+Sarah&isbn=9781321921144&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","Memory; Social psychology; Psychology; 0451:Social psychology; Communication; 0633:Cognitive psychology; Cognitive psychology; Communication and the arts; 0459:Communication; Alibi; Deception; Linguistic inquiry word count; Reality monitoring; Witness statement",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We also argued that episodic recollection should be configural (tending towards all-or-nothing recall of the WWW elements). Our first deferred imitation experiment, using a two-dimensional (2D) display, produced superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but no evidence of configural memory. Moreover, performance did not differ from that on a What-What-What control task. Our second deferred imitation study required the children to reproduce actions on an object in a room, thereby affording layout-based spatial cues. In this case, not only was there superior-to-chance performance after 2.5 years but memory was also configural at both ages.

Individuals with DS recall better where an object was previously seen than what object was previously seen. However, most of the evidence concerning preserved visuospatial memory comes from tabletop or computerized experiments which are biased toward testing egocentric (viewpoint-dependent) spatial representations. Accordingly, allocentric (viewpoint-independent) spatial learning and memory capacities may not be necessary to perform these tasks. Thus, in order to more fully characterize the spatial capacities of individuals with DS, allocentric processes underlying real-world navigation must also be investigated. We tested 20 participants with DS and 16 mental age-matched, typically developing (TD) children in a real-world, allocentric spatial (AS) memory task. During local cue (LC) trials, participants had to locate three rewards marked by local color cues, among 12 locations distributed in a 4 m Ã— 4 m arena. During AS trials, participants had to locate the same three rewards, in absence of LCs, based on their relations to distal environmental cues. All TD participants chose rewarded locations in LC and AS trials at above chance level. In contrast, although all but one of the participants with DS exhibited a preference for the rewarded locations in LC trials, only 50% of participants with DS chose the rewarded locations at above chance level in AS trials. As a group, participants with DS performed worse than TD children on all measures of task performance.These findings demonstrate that individuals with DS are impaired at using an AS representation to learn and remember discrete locations in a controlled environment, suggesting persistent and pervasive deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory in DS.

However recent research suggests that memories are often retrieved directly, without effortful search. We investigated whether direct and generative retrieval differed in the characteristics of memories recalled, or only in terms of retrieval latency. Participants recalled autobiographical memories in response to cue words. For each memory, they reported whether it was retrieved directly or generatively, rated its visuo-spatial perspective, and judged its accompanying recollective experience. Our results indicated that direct retrieval was commonly reported and was faster than generative retrieval, replicating recent findings. The characteristics of directly retrieved memories differed from generatively retrieved memories: directly retrieved memories had higher field perspective ratings and lower observer perspective ratings. However, retrieval mode did not influence recollective experience.

Here we report data from three healthy, high functioning adults with the reverse pattern: lifelong severely deficient autobiographical memory (SDAM) with otherwise preserved cognitive function. Their self-reported selective inability to vividly recollect personally experienced events from a first-person perspective was corroborated by absence of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) biomarkers associated with naturalistic and laboratory episodic recollection, as well as by behavioral evidence of impaired episodic retrieval, particularly for visual information. Yet learning and memory were otherwise intact, as long as these tasks could be accomplished by non-episodic processes. Thus these individuals function normally in day-to-day life, even though their past is experienced in the absence of recollection.","2015-06","2018-06-18 10:56:55","2018-06-19 10:16:00",NA,"105-118",NA,"","72",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1681915370; 25892594",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S002839321500158X/1-s2.0-S002839321500158X-main.pdf?_tid=127b0937-bea7-427f-9341-2763aa1c7752&acdnat=1529062060_48ba07bbedd3952a78bf9dbb4ace13d3; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Severely+deficient+autobiographical+memory+%28SDAM%29+in+healthy+adults%3A+A+new+mnemonic+syndrome.&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=1873-3514&date=2015-06-01&volume=72&issue=&spage=105&au=Palombo%2C+Daniela+J%3BAlain%2C+Claude%3BS%C3%B6derlund%2C+Hedvig%3BKhuu%2C+Wayne%3BLevine%2C+Brian&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/25892594&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2015.04.012; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Severely+deficient+autobiographical+memory+%28SDAM%29+in+healthy+adults%3A+A+new+mnemonic+syndrome&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=00283932&date=2015-06-01&volume=72&issue=&spage=105&au=Palombo%2C+Daniela+J.%3BAlain%2C+Claude%3BS%C3%B6derlund%2C+Hedvig%3BKhuu%2C+Wayne%3BLevine%2C+Brian&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2015-23312-013&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2015.04.012","*Memory, Episodic; 3297:Neurological Disorders & Brain Damage; Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Brain Imaging; Brain Mapping; Case study; Case-Control Studies; Cues; Empirical Study; Episodic memory; Evoked Potentials; Evoked Potentials -- physiology; Evoked Potentials/physiology; Female; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Hippocampus -- blood supply; Hippocampus -- physiopathology; Hippocampus/blood supply/*physiopathology; Human; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Index Medicus; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory Disorders; Memory Disorders -- pathology; Memory Disorders -- physiopathology; Memory Disorders/*pathology/*physiopathology; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Mental Recall -- physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Oxygen; Oxygen -- blood; Oxygen/blood; Quantitative Study; S88TT14065; Statistics, Nonparametric; Verbal Learning; Verbal Learning -- physiology; Verbal Learning/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research from different laboratories reported that basic allocentric spatial memory abilities are reliably observed in children after 2 years of age. Based on work performed in monkeys and rats, we had proposed that the functional maturation of direct entorhinal cortex projections to the CA1 field of the hippocampus might underlie the emergence of basic allocentric spatial memory. We also proposed that the protracted development of the dentate gyrus and its projections to the CA3 field of the hippocampus might underlie the development of high-resolution allocentric spatial memory capacities, based on the essential contribution of these structures to the process known as pattern separation. Here, we present an experiment designed to assess the development of spatial pattern separation capacities and its impact on allocentric spatial memory performance in children from 18 to 48 months of age. We found that: (1) allocentric spatial memory performance improved with age, (2) as compared to younger children, a greater number of children older than 36 months advanced to the final stage requiring the highest degree of spatial resolution, and (3) children that failed at different stages exhibited difficulties in discriminating locations that required higher spatial resolution abilities. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that improvements in human spatial memory performance might be linked to improvements in pattern separation capacities.

The resulting architecture includes striatal reinforcement learning based on egocentric representations of sensory states and actions, incidental Hebbian association of sensory information with allocentric state representations in the hippocampus, and arbitration of the outputs of both systems based on confidence/uncertainty in medial prefrontal cortex.

We investigated allocentric spatial recall using a virtual environment in a group of patients with severe hippocampal damage (SHD), a group of patients with ""moderate"" hippocampal damage (MHD), and a normal control group. Through four learning blocks with feedback, participants learned the target locations of four different objects in a circular arena. Distal cues were present throughout the experiment to provide orientation. A circular boundary as well as an intra-arena landmark provided spatial reference frames. During a subsequent test phase, recall of all four objects was tested with only the boundary or the landmark being present. Patients with SHD were impaired in both phases of this task. Across groups, performance on both types of spatial recall was highly correlated with memory quotient (MQ), but not with intelligence quotient (IQ), age, or sex. However, both measures of spatial recall separated experimental groups beyond what would be expected based on MQ, a widely used measure of general memory function. Boundary-based and landmark-based spatial recall were both strongly related to bilateral hippocampal volumes, but not to volumes of the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, nucleus accumbens, or caudate nucleus. The results show that boundary-based and landmark-based allocentric spatial recall are similarly impaired in patients with SHD, that both types of recall are impaired beyond that predicted by MQ, and that recall deficits are best explained by a reduction in bilateral hippocampal volumes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn humans, bilateral hippocampal atrophy can lead to profound impairments in episodic memory. Across species, perhaps the most well-established contribution of the hippocampus to memory is not to episodic memory generally but to allocentric spatial memory. However, the extent to which navigational spatial memory depends on hippocampal integrity in humans is not well documented. We investigated spatial recall using a virtual environment in two groups of patients with hippocampal damage (moderate/severe) and a normal control group. The results showed that patients with severe hippocampal damage are impaired in learning and recalling allocentric spatial information. Furthermore, hippocampal volume reduction impaired allocentric navigation beyond what can be predicted by memory quotient as a widely used measure of general memory function.","2015-10-21","2018-06-18 10:57:05","2018-06-18 12:35:08",NA,"14123-14131",NA,"42","35",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1728053141; 26490854",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Hippocampal+Volume+Reduction+in+Humans+Predicts+Impaired+Allocentric+Spatial+Memory+in+Virtual-Reality+Navigation.&title=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&issn=1529-2401&date=2015-10-21&volume=35&issue=42&spage=14123&au=Guderian%2C+Sebastian%3BDzieciol%2C+Anna+M%3BGadian%2C+David+G%3BJentschke%2C+Sebastian%3BDoeller%2C+Christian+F%3BBurgess%2C+Neil%3BMishkin%2C+Mortimer%3BVargha-Khadem%2C+Faraneh&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/26490854&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.0801-15.2015; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1728053141?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Hippocampal+Volume+Reduction+in+Humans+Predicts+Impaired+Allocentric+Spatial+Memory+in+Virtual-Reality+Navigation.&title=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&issn=1529-2401&date=2015-10-21&volume=35&issue=42&spage=14123&au=Guderian%2C+Sebastian%3BDzieciol%2C+Anna+M%3BGadian%2C+David+G%3BJentschke%2C+Sebastian%3BDoeller%2C+Christian+F%3BBurgess%2C+Neil%3BMishkin%2C+Mortimer%3BVargha-Khadem%2C+Faraneh&isbn=&jtitle=The+Journal+of+neuroscience+%3A+the+official+journal+of+the+Society+for+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/26490854&rft_id=info:doi/10.1523%2FJNEUROSCI.0801-15.2015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4683681/pdf/zns14123.pdf","Adult; Humans; Male; memory; Intelligence; Child; spatial; Adolescent; Female; Young Adult; Mental Recall; Index Medicus; User-Computer Interface; Age Factors; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Brain Injuries -- complications; Memory Disorders -- etiology; navigation; amnesia; virtual reality; Hippocampus -- pathology; Spatial Navigation -- physiology; Brain Injuries -- etiology; Brain Injuries -- pathology; Brain Ischemia -- complications; human; Regression Analysis; Spatial Navigation/*physiology; Memory Disorders/*etiology; *User-Computer Interface; Brain Injuries/*complications/etiology/*pathology; Brain Ischemia/complications; Hippocampus/*pathology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast, memories from the observer, or third person, perspective, tend to be more general, less detail-oriented and emotional. Research suggests that individuals with a history of suicidality exhibit over-general autobiographical memories (i.e., lacking in detail). We propose that individuals with a history of suicidality may encode and recall memories more from the observer perspective, which is associated with recalling fewer details about events. This hypothesis was tested by examining the memory perspectives of 107 young adults with and without symptoms of suicidality during task and event recall. Compared to controls, suicide attempters recalled tasks and neutral events significantly less from the observer perspective and more from the field perspective; suicide ideators and controls were not significantly different on recall perspectives. No significant differences in negative event and suicide attempt recall were found across groups. Results indicated that suicide attempters exhibited a recall bias towards first person, internally focused memories. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

In the striking neurological syndrome called representational or imaginal neglect, patients with right brain damage fail to report contralesional, left-sided elements of familiar places relative to their imaginary vantage point. Notwithstanding descriptions of single cases of representational neglect dissociated from perceptual or visual neglect, it is still unknown whether this disorder is due to specific brain lesions. Here we show that the ability to properly recall and inspect places from memory is supported by a neural network dissociated from that necessary to properly scan single objects from memory or the external visual world. Lesion-symptoms mapping of 40 right-damaged patients with and without imaginal neglect identified a peak region located at the posterior junction between the parietal and temporal lobes (pTPJ), where the angular and supramarginal gyri abut on the posterior temporal cortex. This region is known to support first-person perspective transformations and is connected with systems relevant for navigation and retrieval from autobiographical memory.

Specifically, we examined the frequency with which participants remembered past events or imagined future events from third-person perspectives. We also examined the different viewpoints from which third-person perspective events were remembered or imagined. Although future events were somewhat more likely to be imagined from a third-person perspective, the spatial viewpoint distributions of third-person perspectives characterizing remembered and imagined events were highly similar. These results suggest that a similar constructive mechanism may be at work when people remember events from a perspective that could not have been experienced in the past and when they imagine events from a perspective that could not be experienced in the future.

To develop a short form of the MEQ to use when time is limited, participants from two samples (N = 719; N = 352) retrieved autobiographical memories, rated the phenomenological experience of each memory and completed several scales measuring psychological distress. For each MEQ dimension, the number of items was reduced by one-half based on item content and item-total correlations.

Case studies have demonstrated that a properly functioning hippocampus is required to form new episodic memories. But hippocampal cellular electrophysiology has traditionally studied hippocampal function by quantifying the role of the hippocampus in navigation and spatial localization through â€œplace cells.â€ The mechanisms through which allocentric spatial representations arise from egocentric sensory cues are not well-understood, nor are the ways in which these representations are used to navigate or relate to episodic memory. This dissertation addresses three key issues in understanding the mechanisms of episodic memory.    First, in vivo electrophysiology has traditionally focused on somatic spiking as the output of the brain structures under study, completely ignoring the activity in the massive dendritic arbors that neurons maintain, and which have been proposed to have important contributions to neural computation. Here we describe development of a novel recording method and report the first long-term recordings during unrestrained, natural behavior of cortical dendritic activity representing egocentric motion.  Second, confounds between different sensory or behavioral parameters can lead to problems in interpreting analyses when traditional methods of determining neural receptive fields are used. This work develops and applies powerful statistical analyses known as generalized linear models to identify the independent contributions of different sensory modalities to hippocampal tuning. Finally, in vivo electrophysiology has never been performed in the Morris Water Maze, one of the most widely-used behavioral tests of spatial memory, largely due to the incompatibility of water with recording electronics. By training rats to do an analogous task in virtual reality, we demonstrate that hippocampal pyramidal cells, which function as place cells in most environments, do not encode allocentric position in this task, but rather encode episodic distance within trials.    This multiple-level investigation of episodic memory, from cortical dendrites to hippocampal soma, is facilitated by novel technologies and methods. Each level of analysis reveals important new details of the computational principles utilized by neural circuits, and lead us to a more complete understanding of episodic memory.","2016","2018-06-18 10:57:20","2018-06-19 10:15:15",NA,"",148,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"University of California, Los Angeles","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1795529711",NA,NA,"10119601",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Egocentric+and+Episodic+Navigational+Maps+in+Dendrites+and+Somata+of+Posterior+Parietal+Cortex+and+Dorsal+Hippocampus&issn=&date=2016-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Moore%2C+Jason+James&isbn=9781339808352&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Egocentric+and+Episodic+Navigational+Maps+in+Dendrites+and+Somata+of+Posterior+Parietal+Cortex+and+Dorsal+Hippocampus&issn=&date=2016-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Moore%2C+Jason+James&isbn=9781339808352&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:PsycINFO&atitle=&title=Egocentric+and+episodic+navigational+maps+in+dendrites+and+somata+of+posterior+parietal+cortex+and+dorsal+hippocampus&issn=&date=2017-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Moore%2C+Jason+James&isbn=978-1339808352&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-53066-144&rft_id=info:doi/","0317:Neurosciences; 0544:Electrical engineering; 0786:Biophysics; 2500:Physiological Psychology & Neuroscience; Animal; Applied sciences; Biological sciences; Biophysics; Dendrite; dendrites; Dendrites; Electrical engineering; Electrophysiology; Empirical Study; Episodic memory; hippocampus; Hippocampus; In vivo; neurons; Neurons; Neurosciences; Quantitative Study; technology; Technology; Virtual reality",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent discovery of heterogeneity between distinct subnets (or operational modules - OMs) of the DMN leads to a reconceptualization of its role for the experiential sense of self. Considering the recent proposition that the frontal DMN OM is responsible for the first-person perspective and the sense of agency, while the posterior DMN OMs are linked to the continuity of 'I' experience (including autobiographical memories) through embodiment and localization within bodily space, we have tested in this study the hypothesis that heterogeneity in the operational synchrony strength within the frontal DMN OM among patients who are in a vegetative state (VS) could inform about a stable self-consciousness recovery later in the course of disease (up to six years post-injury). Using EEG operational synchrony analysis we have demonstrated that among the three OMs of the DMN only the frontal OM showed important heterogeneity in VS patients as a function of later stable clinical outcome. We also found that the frontal DMN OM was characterized by the process of active uncoupling (stronger in persistent VS) of operations performed by the involved neuronal assemblies.","2016","2018-06-18 10:57:22","2018-06-18 12:34:08",NA,"41-51",NA,"","10",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1800129175; 27347264",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+Chief+Role+of+Frontal+Operational+Module+of+the+Brain+Default+Mode+Network+in+the+Potential+Recovery+of+Consciousness+from+the+Vegetative+State%3A+A+Preliminary+Comparison+of+Three+Case+Reports.&title=The+open+neuroimaging+journal&issn=18744400&date=2016-01-01&volume=10&issue=&spage=41&au=Fingelkurts%2C+Alexander+A%3BFingelkurts%2C+Andrew+A%3BBagnato%2C+Sergio%3BBoccagni%2C+Cristina%3BGalardi%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=The+open+neuroimaging+journal&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27347264&rft_id=info:doi/10.2174%2F1874440001610010041; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1800129175?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+Chief+Role+of+Frontal+Operational+Module+of+the+Brain+Default+Mode+Network+in+the+Potential+Recovery+of+Consciousness+from+the+Vegetative+State%3A+A+Preliminary+Comparison+of+Three+Case+Reports.&title=The+open+neuroimaging+journal&issn=18744400&date=2016-01-01&volume=10&issue=&spage=41&au=Fingelkurts%2C+Alexander+A%3BFingelkurts%2C+Andrew+A%3BBagnato%2C+Sergio%3BBoccagni%2C+Cristina%3BGalardi%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=The+open+neuroimaging+journal&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27347264&rft_id=info:doi/10.2174%2F1874440001610010041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4894863/pdf/TONIJ-10-41.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4894863/pdf/TONIJ-10-41.pdf","EEG; Alpha rhythm; Default-mode network; DMN; Electroencephalogram; First-person perspective; Functional connectivity; Operational synchrony; Subjective sense of self; Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; Vegetative state; Dmn; Eeg",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we review studies that investigate the deliberate adoption of a third- or first-person vantage perspective and its impact on affect in healthy people, ""sub-clinical"" populations and those with psychological disorders. A systematic search was conducted across four databases. After exclusion criteria were applied, 38 studies were identified that investigated the impact of both imagery and verbal instructions designed to encourage adoption of a third-person perspective on self-reported affect. The identified studies examined a variety of outcomes related to recalling memories, imagining scenarios and mood induction. These were associated with specific negative emotions or mood states (dysphoria/sadness, anxiety, anger), mixed or neutral affect autobiographical memories, and self-conscious affect (e.g., guilt). Engaging a third-person perspective was generally associated with a reduction in the intensity of positive and negative affect. Studies that included measures of semantic change, suggested that this is a key mediator in reduction of affect following perspective change. Strategically adopting a ""distanced,"" third-person perspective is linked to a reduction in affect intensity across valence, but in addition has the potential to introduce new information that regulates emotion via semantic change. Such reappraisal distinguishes deliberate adoption of a distanced perspective from the habitual and/or spontaneous shift in perspective that occurs in psychopathology.","2016","2018-06-18 10:57:26","2018-06-19 10:19:46",NA,"1715",NA,"","7",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1842547670; 27867366",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=The+impact+of+perspective+change+as+a+cognitive+reappraisal+strategy+on+affect%3A+A+systematic+review&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2016-11-04&volume=7&issue=&spage=&au=Wallace-Hadrill%2C+Sophie+M.+A.%3BKamboj%2C+Sunjeev+K.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-59124-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872256277?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095639/pdf/fpsyg-07-01715.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+Impact+of+Perspective+Change+As+a+Cognitive+Reappraisal+Strategy+on+Affect%3A+A+Systematic+Review.&title=Frontiers+in+psychology&issn=16641078&date=2016-01-01&volume=7&issue=&spage=1715&au=Wallace-Hadrill%2C+Sophie+M+A%3BKamboj%2C+Sunjeev+K&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27867366&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=The+impact+of+perspective+change+as+a+cognitive+reappraisal+strategy+on+affect%3A+A+systematic+review&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2016-11-04&volume=7&issue=&spage=&au=Wallace-Hadrill%2C+Sophie+M.+A.%3BKamboj%2C+Sunjeev+K.&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-59124-001&rft_id=info:doi/","3210:Psychological Disorders; affect; article; Cognitive Appraisal; Emotional Regulation; Human; Imagery; Literature Review; Mental Disorders; mental imagery; reappraisal; semantic change; Systematic Review; Time Perspective; vantage perspective",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A recent neurobiological model considers AN as the outcome of dysfunctions in the neuronal processes related to appetite and emotionality (Kaye et al., 2009, 2013). However, this model still is not able to answer a critical question: What is behind body image disturbances (BIDs) in AN? The article starts its analysis from reviewing some of the studies exploring the effects of the serotonin systems in memory (episodic, working, and spatial) and its dysfunctions. The review suggests that serotonin disturbances may: (a) facilitate the encoding of third person (allocentric) episodic memories; (b) facilitate the consolidation of emotional episodic memories (e.g., teasing), if preceded by repeated stress; (c) reduce voluntary inhibition of mnestic contents; (d) impair allocentric spatial memory. If we discuss these results within the interpretative frame suggested by the ""Allocentric Lock Hypothesis"" (Riva, 2012, 2014), we can hypothesize that altered serotoninergic activity in AN patients: (i) improves their ability to store and consolidate negative autobiographical memories, including those of their body, in allocentric perspective; (ii) impairs their ability to trigger voluntary inhibition of the previously stored negative memory of the body; (iii) impairs their capacity to retrieve/update allocentric information. Taken together, these points suggest a possible link between serotonin dysfunctions, memory impairments and BIDs: the impossibility of updating a disturbed body memory using real time experiential data-I'm locked to a wrong body stored in long term memory-pushes AN patients to control body weight and shape even when underweight.","2016","2018-06-18 10:57:27","2018-06-19 10:16:55",NA,"600",NA,"","10",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1847895668; 27932968",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Neurobiology+of+anorexia+nervosa%3A+Serotonin+dysfunctions+link+self-starvation+with+body+image+disturbances+through+an+impaired+body+memory&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2016-11-24&volume=10&issue=&spage=&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-58586-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1851132467?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Neurobiology+of+Anorexia+Nervosa%3A+Serotonin+Dysfunctions+Link+Self-Starvation+with+Body+Image+Disturbances+through+an+Impaired+Body+Memory.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2016-01-01&volume=10&issue=&spage=600&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27932968&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Neurobiology+of+anorexia+nervosa%3A+Serotonin+dysfunctions+link+self-starvation+with+body+image+disturbances+through+an+impaired+body+memory&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2016-11-24&volume=10&issue=&spage=&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-58586-001&rft_id=info:doi/","3260:Eating Disorders; 5-HTTLPR; allocentric lock; Anorexia Nervosa; anorexia nervosa (AN); article; body image disturbances; Body Image Disturbances; Human; Literature Review; Memory; memory consolidation; memory reconsolidation; Neurobiology; serotonin; Serotonin; serotonin transporter gene",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous observation studies have found that action observation can facilitate motor learning: people are able to pick up context-specific cues from others' movements to adapt to a novel mechanical environment. More specifically, an hour of observational learning reduced kinematic errors and produced adaptive changes in predictive limb control, similar to changes induced by physical practice. Here, we investigated action observation over several days, on a time scale more relevant for motor memory and rehabilitation. In particular we envision a first training day as analogous to a ""clinic"" visit, whereas subsequent observational training is analogous to ""at-home"" training through video viewing. We trained 50 subjects in three experiments. On the first day of training, subjects learned a curl, viscous force field by one of the three training schedules: action observation, physical practice, or interleaved blocks of observation and physical practice. In action observation, subjects observed a film of another individual's reaching movements in the force field in first-person perspective. In physical practice, subjects reached while holding a robotic arm that generated the same field. On subsequent days, in experimental conditions, subjects trained in a thirty-minute action observation session. In control conditions, subjects rested for thirty minutes while holding onto the robotic arm. To assess motor adaptation and learning, both within and across training days, we measured predictive force output using an error-clamped force channel, which provided positive reinforcement through straight movement toward the target, while enabling readout of predictive force generation throughout the trajectory. We calculated a scalar metric of motor memory by quantifying the velocity-dependent component of this predictive force, indicative of appropriate learning of the novel field. Overall we found observation to boost motor memory effectively over several days. This retraining seemed effective following either initial observation or initial physical practice. We saw the most dramatic effects following initial combined training, perhaps due to heightened context or Hebb-like pairing of the modalities. Learning via observation therefore has basic science importance and clinical possibilities on time scales relevant to motor memory and recovery, beyond short-term motor adaptation. We conclude that observational training could be a powerful tool for rehabilitation and recovery, both within and between clinic visits.

In Experiment 1, participants performed mini-events and nominated memories of recent autobiographical events in response to cue words. Next, they described their memory for each event and rated its phenomenological characteristics. Over the following three weeks, they repeatedly retrieved half of the mini-event and cue-word memories. No instructions were given about how to retrieve the memories. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to adopt either a first- or third-person perspective during retrieval. One month later, participants retrieved all of the memories and again provided phenomenology ratings. When first-person visual details from the event were repeatedly retrieved, this information was retained better and the shift in perspective was slowed.","2016-05","2018-06-18 10:57:37","2018-06-18 12:31:52",NA,"237-253",NA,"","42",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1793900692; 27064539",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1053810016300472/1-s2.0-S1053810016300472-main.pdf?_tid=46a682f8-dba7-4b8b-9f88-43090440a4eb&acdnat=1529061260_38b181199475f0b9000d136242701ce5; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Visual+imagery+in+autobiographical+memory%3A+The+role+of+repeated+retrieval+in+shifting+perspective.&title=Consciousness+and+cognition&issn=1090-2376&date=2016-05-01&volume=42&issue=&spage=237&au=Butler%2C+Andrew+C%3BRice%2C+Heather+J%3BWooldridge%2C+Cynthia+L%3BRubin%2C+David+C&isbn=&jtitle=Consciousness+and+cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27064539&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.concog.2016.03.018; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1793900692?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Visual+imagery+in+autobiographical+memory%3A+The+role+of+repeated+retrieval+in+shifting+perspective.&title=Consciousness+and+cognition&issn=1090-2376&date=2016-05-01&volume=42&issue=&spage=237&au=Butler%2C+Andrew+C%3BRice%2C+Heather+J%3BWooldridge%2C+Cynthia+L%3BRubin%2C+David+C&isbn=&jtitle=Consciousness+and+cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27064539&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.concog.2016.03.018; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Visual+imagery+in+autobiographical+memory%3A+The+role+of+repeated+retrieval+in+shifting+perspective&title=Consciousness+and+Cognition%3A+An+International+Journal&issn=10538100&date=2016-05-01&volume=42&issue=&spage=237&au=Butler%2C+Andrew+C.%3BRice%2C+Heather+J.%3BWooldridge%2C+Cynthia+L.%3BRubin%2C+David+C.&isbn=&jtitle=Consciousness+and+Cognition%3A+An+International+Journal&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-27640-022&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.concog.2016.03.018","Adult; Humans; Recall (Learning); Human; Young Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; 2343:Learning & Memory; Autobiographical Memory; Index Medicus; Autobiographical memory; Mental Recall -- physiology; Quantitative Study; Visual perspective; Imagination -- physiology; Visual Perception -- physiology; Memory, Episodic; Retrieval; Visual imagery; Lexical Access; *Autobiographical memory; *Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall/*physiology; Visual Perception/*physiology; Imagination/*physiology; *Visual perspective; *Retrieval; *Visual imagery",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examined neural links between emotion regulation and suicide risk in BPD. 60 individuals with BPD (all female, mean ageÂ =Â 28.9 years), 46 of whom had attempted suicide, completed a fMRI task involving recalling aversive personal memories. Distance trials assessed the ability to regulate emotion by recalling memories from a third-person, objective viewpoint. Immerse trials assessed emotional reactivity and involved recalling memories from a first-person perspective. Behaviorally, both groups reported less negative affect on Distance as compared to Immerse trials. Neurally, two sets of findings were obtained. The first reflected differences between attempters and non-attempters. When immersing and distancing, attempters showed elevated recruitment of lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region implicated in using negative cues to guide behavior. When distancing, attempters showed diminished recruitment of the precuneus, a region implicated in memory recall and perspective taking. The second set of findings related to individual differences in regulation success - the degree to which individuals used distancing to reduce negative affect. Here, we observed that attempters who successfully regulated exhibited precuneus recruitment that was more similar to non-attempters. These data provide insight into mechanisms underlying suicide attempts in BPD. Future work may examine if these findings generalize to other diagnoses and also whether prior findings in BPD differ across attempters and non-attempters.","2016-10","2018-06-18 10:57:43","2018-06-19 10:18:24",NA,"71-78",NA,"","81",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1819431698; 27392071",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022395616301273/1-s2.0-S0022395616301273-main.pdf?_tid=68a4c545-0a06-4bd7-aee7-1b031c34fb3a&acdnat=1529061894_2a994a10ae35567e93fb2fe0a0e35f37; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Suicide+attempters+with+Borderline+Personality+Disorder+show+differential+orbitofrontal+and+parietal+recruitment+when+reflecting+on+aversive+memories.&title=Journal+of+psychiatric+research&issn=1879-1379&date=2016-10-01&volume=81&issue=&spage=71&au=Silvers%2C+Jennifer+A%3BHubbard%2C+Alexa+D%3BChaudhury%2C+Sadia%3BBiggs%2C+Emily%3BShu%2C+Jocelyn%3BGrunebaum%2C+Michael+F%3BFertuck%2C+Eric%3BWeber%2C+Jochen%3BKober%2C+Hedy%3BCarson-Wong%2C+Amanda%3BBrodsky%2C+Beth+S%3BChesin%2C+Megan%3BOchsner%2C+Kevin+N%3BStanley%2C+Barbara&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+psychiatric+research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27392071&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jpsychires.2016.06.020; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1819431698?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Suicide+attempters+with+Borderline+Personality+Disorder+show+differential+orbitofrontal+and+parietal+recruitment+when+reflecting+on+aversive+memories.&title=Journal+of+psychiatric+research&issn=1879-1379&date=2016-10-01&volume=81&issue=&spage=71&au=Silvers%2C+Jennifer+A%3BHubbard%2C+Alexa+D%3BChaudhury%2C+Sadia%3BBiggs%2C+Emily%3BShu%2C+Jocelyn%3BGrunebaum%2C+Michael+F%3BFertuck%2C+Eric%3BWeber%2C+Jochen%3BKober%2C+Hedy%3BCarson-Wong%2C+Amanda%3BBrodsky%2C+Beth+S%3BChesin%2C+Megan%3BOchsner%2C+Kevin+N%3BStanley%2C+Barbara&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+psychiatric+research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27392071&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jpsychires.2016.06.020; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Suicide+attempters+with+Borderline+Personality+Disorder+show+differential+orbitofrontal+and+parietal+recruitment+when+reflecting+on+aversive+memories&title=Journal+of+Psychiatric+Research&issn=00223956&date=2016-10-01&volume=81&issue=&spage=71&au=Silvers%2C+Jennifer+A.%3BHubbard%2C+Alexa+D.%3BChaudhury%2C+Sadia%3BBiggs%2C+Emily%3BShu%2C+Jocelyn%3BGrunebaum%2C+Michael+F.%3BFertuck%2C+Eric%3BWeber%2C+Jochen%3BKober%2C+Hedy%3BCarson-Wong%2C+Amanda%3BBrodsky%2C+Beth+S.%3BChesin%2C+Megan%3BOchsner%2C+Kevin+N.%3BStanley%2C+Barbara&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Psychiatric+Research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-45480-011&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.jpsychires.2016.06.020","*Borderline Personality Disorder; *Emotion regulation; *Neuroimaging; *Suicide; 3217:Personality Disorders; Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Analysis of Variance; article; Attempted Suicide; Avoidance Learning -- physiology; Avoidance Learning/physiology; Borderline Personality Disorder; Borderline Personality Disorder -- pathology; Borderline Personality Disorder -- psychology; Borderline Personality Disorder/*pathology/*psychology; Brain Imaging; Emotion regulation; Emotional Regulation; Empirical Study; Female; Frontal Lobe; Human; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Index Medicus; Interview; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory -- physiology; Memory/*physiology; Neuroimaging; Oxygen; Oxygen -- blood; Oxygen/blood; Parietal Lobe -- diagnostic imaging; Parietal Lobe/*diagnostic imaging; Prefrontal Cortex -- diagnostic imaging; Prefrontal Cortex/*diagnostic imaging; Quantitative Study; S88TT14065; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted -- psychology; Suicide, Attempted/*psychology; US; Young Adult",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results showed that when narrative perspectives effectively shifted participants' visual perspectives from field to observer, they felt attenuated emotional intensities of positive and negative autobiographical memories. However, this did not occur when narrative perspectives effectively shifted the visual perspectives from observer to field. Multiple mediator models further showed that the changes in psychological distance and imagery vividness (a distance-related construct) of autobiographical memory mediated the relationship between the narrative perspective shift from the 1st- to 3rd-person and the reduction in the intensities of negative and positive emotion.

Allocentric spatial memory is assessed by altering the viewpoint, colors and textures between the initially presented and target images. Allocentric spatial memory is a key function of the hippocampus, one of the earliest brain regions to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and impairment of hippocampal function predates the onset of dementia. It was hypothesized that performance on the 4MT would aid the diagnosis of predementia AD, which manifests clinically as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). The 4MT was applied to patients with MCI, stratified further based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarker status (10 MCI biomarker positive, 9 MCI biomarker negative), and with mild AD dementia, as well as healthy controls. Comparator tests included tests of episodic memory and attention widely accepted as sensitive measures of early AD. Behavioral data were correlated with quantitative MRI measures of the hippocampus, precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus. 4MT scores were significantly different between the two MCI groups (p = 0.001), with a test score of â‰¤8/15 associated with 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity for the classification of MCI with positive AD biomarkers, i.e., predementia AD. 4MT test scores correlated with hippocampal volume (r = 0.42) and cortical thickness of the precuneus (r = 0.55). In conclusion, the 4MT is effective in identifying the early stages of AD. The short duration, easy application and scoring, and favorable psychometric properties of the 4MT fulfil the need for a simple but accurate diagnostic test for predementia AD.","2016-10-13","2018-06-18 10:57:51","2018-06-18 12:32:25",NA,"",NA,"116","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1835523500; 27768046",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+4+Mountains+Test%3A+A+Short+Test+of+Spatial+Memory+with+High+Sensitivity+for+the+Diagnosis+of+Pre-dementia+Alzheimer%27s+Disease.&title=Journal+of+visualized+experiments+%3A+JoVE&issn=1940-087X&date=2016-10-13&volume=&issue=116&spage=&au=Chan%2C+Dennis%3BGallaher%2C+Laura+Marie%3BMoodley%2C+Kuven%3BMinati%2C+Ludovico%3BBurgess%2C+Neil%3BHartley%2C+Tom&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+visualized+experiments+%3A+JoVE&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27768046&rft_id=info:doi/10.3791%2F54454; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835523500?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+4+Mountains+Test%3A+A+Short+Test+of+Spatial+Memory+with+High+Sensitivity+for+the+Diagnosis+of+Pre-dementia+Alzheimer%27s+Disease.&title=Journal+of+visualized+experiments+%3A+JoVE&issn=1940-087X&date=2016-10-13&volume=&issue=116&spage=&au=Chan%2C+Dennis%3BGallaher%2C+Laura+Marie%3BMoodley%2C+Kuven%3BMinati%2C+Ludovico%3BBurgess%2C+Neil%3BHartley%2C+Tom&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+visualized+experiments+%3A+JoVE&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27768046&rft_id=info:doi/10.3791%2F54454","Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Hippocampus; Psychometrics; Female; Index Medicus; Spatial Memory; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Alzheimer Disease -- diagnosis; Cognitive Dysfunction -- diagnosis; Dementia -- diagnosis",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The additional insight that consciousness reflects the formation (as opposed to consolidation) of event (episodic) memories links the pathophysiology of hallucinations to the hippocampus. Perceptions and misperceptions, insofar as they are consciously experienced, constitute contextualized and unitary phenomena (which are embedded as discrete events in the stream of consciousness); they are experiential manifestations of activity patters that recurrently emerge in the CA3 network of the hippocampus (and that are secondarily consolidated into retrievable and declarable memories). The hippocampus, forming allocentric representations of objects in their world context (event memories), is a point of convergence of neocortical sensory processing streams. Moreover, being extensively modulated by the organism's physiological state, the hippocampus embeds such representations in an emotional context and, through its output to the medial prefrontal cortex, guides decision-making and goal-selection processes. Although sensory and associative processing in the neocortex makes an important contribution to the formation of behaviourally adaptive representations in the hippocampus, it is becoming clearer that pattern formation in the hippocampus is in itself the neural correlate of consciousness and that disruptions in relational memory processing in the hippocampus can give rise to hallucinations. Neurobiological and neuroimaging findings in schizophrenia research can be integrated within the proposed conceptual framework.","2016-11-03","2018-06-18 10:57:54","2018-06-18 12:26:59",NA,"203-209",NA,"","71",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1814143359; 27492675",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Hallucinatory+experience+as+aberrant+event+memory+formation%3A+Implications+for+the+pathophysiology+of+schizophrenia.&title=Progress+in+neuro-psychopharmacology+%26+biological+psychiatry&issn=1878-4216&date=2016-11-03&volume=71&issue=&spage=203&au=Behrendt%2C+Ralf-Peter&isbn=&jtitle=Progress+in+neuro-psychopharmacology+%26+biological+psychiatry&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27492675&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.pnpbp.2016.07.009; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1814143359?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Hallucinatory+experience+as+aberrant+event+memory+formation%3A+Implications+for+the+pathophysiology+of+schizophrenia.&title=Progress+in+neuro-psychopharmacology+%26+biological+psychiatry&issn=1878-4216&date=2016-11-03&volume=71&issue=&spage=203&au=Behrendt%2C+Ralf-Peter&isbn=&jtitle=Progress+in+neuro-psychopharmacology+%26+biological+psychiatry&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27492675&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.pnpbp.2016.07.009; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Hallucinatory+experience+as+aberrant+event+memory+formation%3A+Implications+for+the+pathophysiology+of+schizophrenia&title=Progress+in+Neuro-Psychopharmacology+%26+Biological+Psychiatry&issn=02785846&date=2016-11-03&volume=71&issue=&spage=203&au=Behrendt%2C+Ralf-Peter&isbn=&jtitle=Progress+in+Neuro-Psychopharmacology+%26+Biological+Psychiatry&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-42337-026&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.pnpbp.2016.07.009","Humans; Imagination; Human; Episodic Memory; Hippocampus; Schizophrenia; Consciousness; article; Index Medicus; Animal; Consciousness States; Episodic memory; Hippocampus -- physiopathology; 2500:Physiological Psychology & Neuroscience; Consciousness -- physiology; Memory Disorders -- etiology; 3213:Schizophrenia & Psychotic States; Hallucinations -- complications; Schizophrenia -- pathology; Schizophrenia -- physiopathology; Pathophysiology; *Episodic memory; *Consciousness; *Hippocampus; *Schizophrenia; Consciousness/physiology; Hallucinations/*complications; Hippocampus/physiopathology; Memory Disorders/*etiology; Schizophrenia/pathology/*physiopathology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Virtual reality allows users to create, explore and interact within environments that are perceived as near to reality. Typically, users entering a VR lab feel as being a part of this world and behave as if they were in the real world. Specifically, even if users do not always move their bodies in the real space, users have the subjective perception of being â€œin action.â€ Three main features that VR implements may have an impact on episodic memory in elderly: First VR allows to experience from an egocentric point of view. Second, VR allows active navigation while the user actively explores the environment by manipulating keyboards, joysticks, or controllers. Third, VR provides environmental enrichment by using flexible scenarios.

However, although a growing body of interesting models have been proposed to explain this early symptom, what is still missing is a unifying framework of all the characteristic signs occurring in patients with AD that may guide the search for its causal neuropathological process and, ultimately, the etiological process. This contribution will first show how anosognosia may be related to the above-mentioned episodic and spatial memory impairment through a unifying framework of all these characteristic signs, i.e., the continuous interaction between different spatial representations. Second, we hypothesize that a break in the interaction between different spatial representations, as we suggest occurs in AD, may contribute significantly both to the early impairments in spatial and episodic memory, and to a deficient self-awareness since it may interfere with the capacity of the brain to detect predictive errors.","2017","2018-06-18 10:58:04","2018-06-18 10:58:04",NA,"881-892",NA,"3","55",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1835519133; 27767990",NA,NA,"",NA,"","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+Proactive+Self+in+Space%3A+How%C2%A0Egocentric+and+Allocentric+Spatial+Impairments+Contribute+to+Anosognosia+in%C2%A0Alzheimer%27s+Disease.&title=Journal+of+Alzheimer%27s+disease+%3A+JAD&issn=1875-8908&date=2017-01-01&volume=55&issue=3&spage=881&au=Serino%2C+Silvia%3BRiva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Alzheimer%27s+disease+%3A+JAD&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27767990&rft_id=info:doi/","Humans; Male; episodic memory; Female; Index Medicus; Neuropsychological Tests; Alzheimer Disease -- complications; Memory, Episodic; Alzheimerâ€™s disease; Agnosia -- etiology; Allocentric reference frame; anosognosia; Awareness -- physiology; egocentric reference frame",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Autobiographical memories can be retrieved either from a first-person or a third-person visual perspective. Because narcissism is linked to sensitivity to psychological threats, it should predict retrieval of self-threatening memories using the third-person perspective. Genuine self-esteem, on the other hand, is resilient to threats. Therefore, it should be associated with retrieving self-relevant, even if threatening, memories from the first-person perspective. In two experiments we measured narcissism and self-esteem. Experiment 1 manipulated valence of self-relevant memories by asking participants to recall self-threatening (shameful) or self-boosting (proud) situations. Experiment 2 manipulated self-relevance of negative memories by asking participants to recall self-threatening (shameful) or negative, yet not self-threatening (sad) situations. Visual perspective of memory retrieval served as the dependent variable. In Experiment 1, narcissism predicted avoiding the first-person perspective and employing the third-person perspective in self-threatening memories. Genuine self-esteem predicted employing the first-person perspective regardless of the memories being self-threatening or self-boosting. In Experiment 2, narcissism predicted the third-person perspective, while genuine self-esteem predicted the first-person perspective when self-threatening memories were recalled. Neither narcissism, nor genuine self-esteem were associated with visual perspective when participants recalled negative memories irrelevant to the self. Results shed light on the role of self-evaluation in processing autobiographical memories.

The self-defining moral memory was shown to be relatively more easy to access (accessibility), logically structured (coherence), vivid, seen from the first-person perspective (visual perspective), real (sensory detail); but was relatively less positive (valence), emotionally intense, chronologically clear (time perspective), in agreement with the present self (distancing), and shared. Finally, it was indicated that the more guilt people felt the more hidden/denied (less accessible), but more real (more sensory details), the self-defining moral memory.","2017","2018-06-18 10:58:10","2018-06-19 10:13:25",NA,"750",NA,"","8",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1902480091; 28539906",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Guilt+as+a+motivator+for+moral+judgment%3A+An+autobiographical+memory+study&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2017-05-10&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Knez%2C+Igor%3BNordhall%2C+Ola&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-23733-001&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1930470376?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Guilt+as+a+Motivator+for+Moral+Judgment%3A+An+Autobiographical+Memory+Study.&title=Frontiers+in+psychology&issn=16641078&date=2017-01-01&volume=8&issue=&spage=750&au=Knez%2C+Igor%3BNordhall%2C+Ola&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28539906&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffpsyg.2017.00750; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Guilt+as+a+motivator+for+moral+judgment%3A+An+autobiographical+memory+study&title=Frontiers+in+Psychology&issn=1664-1078&date=2017-05-10&volume=8&issue=&spage=&au=Knez%2C+Igor%3BNordhall%2C+Ola&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Psychology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-23733-001&rft_id=info:doi/","3120:Personality Traits & Processes; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Aged (65 yrs & older); article; autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Empirical Study; Female; guilt; Guilt; Human; Judgment; Male; Middle Age (40-64 yrs); moral intention; Morality; Quantitative Study; Self-Perception; the self; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs)",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Landmarks, both local and global, have been shown to control the spatial representations hypothesized to underlie cognitive maps. Consequently, it has recently been suggested that information processing within this network might be organized with reference to spatial scale with LEC and MEC providing information about local and global spatial frameworks respectively. In the present study, we trained animals to search for food using either a local or global spatial framework. Animals were re-tested on both tasks after receiving excitotoxic lesions of either the MEC or LEC. LEC lesioned animals were impaired in their ability to learn a local spatial framework task. LEC lesioned animals were also impaired on an object recognition (OR) task involving multiple local features but unimpaired at recognizing a single familiar object. Together, this suggests that LEC is involved in associating features of the local environment.

This contribution will first show how anosognosia may be related to the above-mentioned episodic and spatial memory impairment through a unifying framework of all these characteristic signs, i.e., the continuous interaction between different spatial representations. Second, we hypothesize that a break in the interaction between different spatial representations, as we suggest occurs in AD, may contribute significantly both to the early impairments in spatial and episodic memory, and to a deficient self-awareness since it may interfere with the capacity of the brain to detect predictive errors.

MTT can occur voluntarily, whereby a past/future autobiographical event is subjectively experienced as an intended occurrence, or involuntarily, wherein such an event is subjectively experienced as an unintended outcome of which the individual is aware. Studies investigating MTTâ€™s characteristics in dysphoria and depression show that dysphoric and depressed individuals produce more overgeneral and negative MTT events when compared to control groups. However, existing research has been limited to past and voluntary MTT events, with few studies investigating involuntary MTT and future MTT in dysphoria and depression. The overarching aim of the present research was to compare the phenomenological characteristics of MTT in dysphoric individuals vs. normal mood individuals (Study 1), and in clinically depressed individuals vs. never-depressed individuals (Study 2), with the purpose of furthering existing knowledge on MTT and its relation with dysphoria and Major Depressive Disorder. This aim was addressed by conducting two studies, using a 2 x (2 x 2) mixed-factorial design, with temporality (past vs. future events) and type of retrieval (voluntary vs. involuntary events) as within-subjects independent variables, and participant group as a between-subjects variable. In Study 1, Portuguese university students were categorised into a dysphoric (n=17) or a normal mood group (n=39) depending on their score on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-IA) â€“ cutoff point (â‰¥ 10). In Study 2, clinically diagnosed depressed patients (n=32) were recruited from a Portuguese hospital and matched for age and gender with never-depressed control participants (n=32) recruited from the community. The dependent variables tested were: level of spatiotemporal specificity, self-relevance, mood and physical impact, valence, and visual perspective of the MTT events produced. A diary methodology was used in both studies, with an open-ended time period that lasted for a minimum of two weeks, for participants to record their MTT events and grade them on the above mentioned variables using Likert-type ratings. Between seven and fourteen MTT events were produced for each of the four MTT conditions (past voluntary, past involuntary, future voluntary, future involuntary). Results showed that when compared to their respective control groups, depressed, but not dysphoric participants, exhibited a clear influence of mood on several of the phenomenological characteristics of MTT. In Study 1 there were no statistically significant differences in the specificity, negative valence, and mood/physical impact of the MTT events produced by dysphoric and normal mood participants. On the contrary, in Study 2, results partially supported a lower specificity and fully supported a greater negativity and mood/physical impact of MTT events in depressed individuals compared with never-depressed participants. Both studies supported the greater self-relevance of voluntary MTT events and partially supported the hypothesised effect of type of retrieval in specificity. These were the first studies to directly compare past and future, voluntary and involuntary MTT events in dysphoric and depressed individuals, addressing existing gaps in the literature. The key limitation is the relatively small sample size of both studies, however each participant was comprehensively assessed for at least two weeks, providing a rich set of reliable data. Despite limitations, this thesis provides novel pilot findings that help understand the similarities and differences between involuntary and voluntary, past and future MTT, as well as providing new information regarding the possible role of MTT in dysphoria and depression.","2017","2018-06-18 10:58:16","2018-06-18 12:34:33",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"The University of Edinburgh (United Kingdom)","Ann Arbor","English","","Ph.D.","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1999216885",NA,NA,"10760927",NA,"; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Voluntary+and+involuntary+mental+time+travel+in+dysphoria+and+depression%3A+characteristics+and+mechanisms&issn=&date=2017-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Garcez+Aur%C3%A9lio+Dos+Santos%2C+Jo%C3%A3o+Pedro&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&atitle=&title=Voluntary+and+involuntary+mental+time+travel+in+dysphoria+and+depression%3A+characteristics+and+mechanisms&issn=&date=2017-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Garcez+Aur%C3%A9lio+Dos+Santos%2C+Jo%C3%A3o+Pedro&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/","Psychology--Abstracting, Bibliographies, Statistics; Social sciences; (UMI)AAI10760927; 9998:No ProQuest subject assigned; http://hdl.handle.net/1842/22968; No ProQuest subject assigned",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, until recently, the understanding of these disorders referred mostly to philosophical considerations. The aim of this work is to examine how the various aspects of autobiographical memory deficits may be considered as possible cognitive mechanisms accounting for self-disorders in patients.METHODSWe performed a theoretical review of the literature on autobiographical memory studies in schizophrenia. Our approach of cognitive psychopathology was grounded in the model of the Self-Memory System put forward by Conway (2005), which posits reciprocal relationships between autobiographical memory and the self. This model stresses the distinction between the working-self and the autobiographical memory knowledge base. The latter contains all autobiographical information stored in our life and is organized according to the specificity of this information. The role of the working-self is to maintain the coherence of the self and to control the access to autobiographical memories and corresponding memory details. The working-self supports an experiential or phenomenological dimension of the self, especially when a highly detailed autobiographical memory is retrieved, and a past event is re-experienced by the rememberer. The working-self also entails a conceptual part, the conceptual self, which contains self-knowledge and self-images.RESULTSOur review showed that autobiographical memories of patients with schizophrenia are less specific and contain fewer phenomenological details than those of healthy participants. Patients also have difficulty assessing the subjective temporal distance of past events, and their ability to re-experience unique past personal events is affected as shown by a reduced conscious recollection and a smaller frequency of Field visual perspective during recall of autobiographical memories. This global alteration of all phenomenological characteristics of autobiographical memories strongly suggests an alteration of the phenomenological dimension of the self in schizophrenia. Since some of these alterations are also found in patients when they plan for future personal events, the ability to mentally travel in time is reduced in patients and reflects an impaired sense of self across time. The literature also shows that self-images are more passive, less coherent and less stable in time in patients compared to healthy participants. These results point to an alteration of the conceptual dimension of the self in schizophrenia. This may be partly explained by a weaker connection between the self and autobiographical memory and by other alterations of autobiographical memories closely linked to the self. In fact, the reminiscence bump is disorganized in patients and comprises poorly detailed memories. Memories grounding self-images are less organized and weakly connected to self-images. Finally, patients have an impaired ability to give a meaning to or to draw lessons from self-defining memories of their life.CONCLUSIONBased on these results, we discuss current and future therapeutic interventions including both cognitive remediation methods and cognitive psychotherapy applied to autobiographical memory. These methods appear relevant to help patients improve both the sense of self associatied with their autobiographical memory retrieval and the coherence and stability of the self.","2017-02","2018-06-18 10:58:17","2018-06-18 12:29:10",NA,"47-54",NA,"1","43",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","fre","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1826695903; 27216589",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216589; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=%5BAutobiographical+memory+and+self-disorders+in+schizophrenia%5D.&title=L%27Encephale&issn=00137006&date=2017-02-01&volume=43&issue=1&spage=47&au=Berna%2C+F%3BPotheegadoo%2C+J%3BAll%C3%A9%2C+M+C%3BCoutelle%2C+R%3BDanion%2C+J-M&isbn=&jtitle=L%27Encephale&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27216589&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.encep.2016.04.003; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Les+troubles+de+la+m%C3%A9moire+autobiographique+et+du+self+dans+la+schizophr%C3%A9nie&title=L%27Enc%C3%A9phale%3A+Revue+de+psychiatrie+clinique+biologique+et+th%C3%A9rapeutique&issn=00137006&date=2017-02-01&volume=43&issue=1&spage=47&au=Berna%2C+F.%3BPotheegadoo%2C+J.%3BAll%C3%A9%2C+M.+C.%3BCoutelle%2C+R.%3BDanion%2C+J.-M.&isbn=&jtitle=L%27Enc%C3%A9phale%3A+Revue+de+psychiatrie+clinique+biologique+et+th%C3%A9rapeutique&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-07512-010&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.encep.2016.04.003","Humans; Human; Schizophrenia; Memory; Cognition; article; Autobiographical Memory; Index Medicus; Autobiographical memory; Literature Review; Mental Recall -- physiology; Self Concept; Self; 3213:Schizophrenia & Psychotic States; Schizophrenic Psychology; Schizophrenia -- complications; Memory, Episodic; Cognitive remediation; IdentitÃ© personnelle; MÃ©moire autobiographique; Memory Disorders -- complications; Memory Disorders -- epidemiology; Personality Disorders -- complications; Personality Disorders -- epidemiology; Personality Disorders -- psychology; RemÃ©diation cognitive; SchizophrÃ©nie; *Schizophrenic Psychology; *Memory, Episodic; *Self Concept; Identite personnelle; Memoire autobiographique; Memory Disorders/complications/epidemiology; Mental Recall/physiology; Personality Disorders/*complications/epidemiology/psychology; Remediation cognitive; Schizophrenia/*complications; Schizophrenie",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to examine differences between memory recall from a field perspective and observer perspective at the neurobiological level, in order to improve our understanding of what is underlying the observed differences at the behavioral level. We conducted a fMRI study in healthy individuals, comparing imagery perspectives during recall of neutral and positive autobiographical memories. Behavioral results revealed field perspective imagery of positive memories, as compared to observer perspective, to be associated with more positive feelings afterwards. At the neurobiological level, contrasting observer perspective to field perspective imagery was associated with greater activity, or less decrease relative to the control visual search task, in the right precuneus and in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Greater activity in the right TPJ during an observer perspective as compared to field perspective could reflect performing a greater shift of perspective and mental state during observer perspective imagery than field perspective imagery. Differential activity in the precuneus may reflect that during observer perspective imagery individuals are more likely to engage in (self-) evaluative processing and visuospatial processing. Our findings contribute to a growing understanding of how imagery perspective can influence the type of information that is recalled and the intensity of the emotional response. Observer perspective imagery may not automatically reduce emotional intensity but this could depend on how the imagined situation is evaluated in relation to the self-concept.","2017-02","2018-06-18 10:58:19","2018-06-18 12:34:58",NA,"13-24",NA,"","111",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1837025905; 27816776",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0278262616302792/1-s2.0-S0278262616302792-main.pdf?_tid=3e53a89f-3377-41d8-bf15-9ef1481f1a21&acdnat=1529061446_0399d54f1f361838e1b61f2087232068; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Mental+imagery+of+positive+and+neutral+memories%3A+A+fMRI+study+comparing+field+perspective+imagery+to+observer+perspective+imagery.&title=Brain+and+cognition&issn=1090-2147&date=2017-02-01&volume=111&issue=&spage=13&au=Grol%2C+Maud%3BVingerhoets%2C+Guy%3BDe+Raedt%2C+Rudi&isbn=&jtitle=Brain+and+cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27816776&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.bandc.2016.09.014; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1837025905?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Mental+imagery+of+positive+and+neutral+memories%3A+A+fMRI+study+comparing+field+perspective+imagery+to+observer+perspective+imagery.&title=Brain+and+cognition&issn=1090-2147&date=2017-02-01&volume=111&issue=&spage=13&au=Grol%2C+Maud%3BVingerhoets%2C+Guy%3BDe+Raedt%2C+Rudi&isbn=&jtitle=Brain+and+cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27816776&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.bandc.2016.09.014; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Mental+imagery+of+positive+and+neutral+memories%3A+A+fMRI+study+comparing+field+perspective+imagery+to+observer+perspective+imagery&title=Brain+and+Cognition&issn=02782626&date=2017-02-01&volume=111&issue=&spage=13&au=Grol%2C+Maud%3BVingerhoets%2C+Guy%3BDe+Raedt%2C+Rudi&isbn=&jtitle=Brain+and+Cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-00377-003&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.bandc.2016.09.014","Adult; Humans; Emotions; Human; fMRI; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory; Precuneus; Adolescent; Female; Young Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; Index Medicus; Autobiographical memory; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Recall -- physiology; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Belgium; Quantitative Study; Temporal Lobe -- physiology; Parietal Lobe -- physiology; Imagination -- physiology; Emotions -- physiology; Brain Imaging; Memory, Episodic; Imagery perspective; Mental imagery; Temporoparietal junction; *Autobiographical memory; *Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall/*physiology; Imagination/*physiology; *fMRI; *Imagery perspective; *Mental imagery; *Precuneus; *Temporoparietal junction; Emotions/*physiology; Parietal Lobe/*physiology; Temporal Lobe/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we first show that single-trial allocentric spatial memory performance improves in children from 3.5 to 7 years of age, during the typical period of childhood amnesia. Second, we show that large individual variation exists in children's performance at this age. Third, and most importantly, we show that improvements in single-trial allocentric spatial memory performance are due to an increasing ability to spatially and temporally separate locations and events.

Although autobiographical memories are typically encoded from the visual perspective of our own eyes they can be retrieved from the perspective of an observer looking at our self. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of shifting visual perspective during long-term memory retrieval and its influence on online and subsequent memories using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants generated specific autobiographical memories from the last five years and rated their visual perspective. In a separate fMRI session, they were asked to retrieve the memories across three repetitions while maintaining the same visual perspective as their initial rating or by shifting to an alternative perspective. Visual perspective shifting during autobiographical memory retrieval was supported by a linear decrease in neural recruitment across repetitions in the posterior parietal cortices. Additional analyses revealed that the precuneus, in particular, contributed to both online and subsequent changes in the phenomenology of memories. Our findings show that flexibly shifting egocentric perspective during autobiographical memory retrieval is supported by the precuneus, and suggest that this manipulation of mental imagery during retrieval has consequences for how memories are retrieved and later remembered.","2017-03-01","2018-06-18 10:58:27","2018-06-18 12:38:17",NA,"103-114",NA,"","148",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1851292898; 27989780",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Shifting+visual+perspective+during+retrieval+shapes+autobiographical+memories&title=NeuroImage&issn=10538119&date=2017-03-01&volume=148&issue=&spage=103&au=Jacques%2C+Peggy+L.+St.%3BSzpunar%2C+Karl+K.%3BSchacter%2C+Daniel+L.&isbn=&jtitle=NeuroImage&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-11389-010&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2016.12.028; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1880370515?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Shifting+visual+perspective+during+retrieval+shapes+autobiographical+memories.&title=NeuroImage&issn=1095-9572&date=2017-03-01&volume=148&issue=&spage=103&au=St+Jacques%2C+Peggy+L%3BSzpunar%2C+Karl+K%3BSchacter%2C+Daniel+L&isbn=&jtitle=NeuroImage&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27989780&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2016.12.028; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Shifting+visual+perspective+during+retrieval+shapes+autobiographical+memories&title=NeuroImage&issn=10538119&date=2017-03-01&volume=148&issue=&spage=103&au=Jacques%2C+Peggy+L.+St.%3BSzpunar%2C+Karl+K.%3BSchacter%2C+Daniel+L.&isbn=&jtitle=NeuroImage&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-11389-010&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2016.12.028","Adult; Algorithms; Humans; Male; Human; fMRI; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Egocentric perspective; Memory; Precuneus; Repetition suppression; Adolescent; Female; Young Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; Index Medicus; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Recall -- physiology; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; Brain; Parietal Lobe -- physiology; Emotions -- physiology; Visual Perception -- physiology; Brain Imaging; Memory, Episodic; Memory, Long-Term -- physiology; Recruitment, Neurophysiological -- physiology; *Memory, Episodic; Emotions/physiology; Memory, Long-Term/physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Recruitment, Neurophysiological/physiology; Visual Perception/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

FernÃ¡ndez argues that even when memory does not preserve the past, some memories can still provide an adaptive benefit for the subject. I explore FernÃ¡ndez's claims focussing on the case of observer perspective memories. For FernÃ¡ndez, observer perspectives are distorted memories because they do not preserve past experience. In contrast, I suggest that observer perspectives can accurately reflect past experience: observer perspectives are not necessarily distorted memories. By looking at the complexity of the relation between remembering trauma from an observer perspective and emotional closure, I also sound a note of caution against FernÃ¡ndez's assertion that observer memories of trauma can be adaptively beneficial. Finally, I suggest that because observer perspectives are not necessarily distorted, but involve a distinct way of thinking about one's past, such memories can be epistemically beneficial.","2017-03","2018-06-18 10:58:32","2018-06-19 10:14:47",NA,"322-332",NA,"","49",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1872581839; 28237834",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1053810016302148/1-s2.0-S1053810016302148-main.pdf?_tid=7932a28d-3d24-4df5-ad66-dd6881de442f&acdnat=1529062121_a608f956d64465e002ad8254418446b3; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Looking+the+past+in+the+eye%3A+Distortion+in+memory+and+the+costs+and+benefits+of+recalling+from+an+observer+perspective.&title=Consciousness+and+cognition&issn=1090-2376&date=2017-03-01&volume=49&issue=&spage=322&au=McCarroll%2C+Christopher+Jude&isbn=&jtitle=Consciousness+and+cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28237834&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.concog.2017.01.014; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872581839?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Looking+the+past+in+the+eye%3A+Distortion+in+memory+and+the+costs+and+benefits+of+recalling+from+an+observer+perspective.&title=Consciousness+and+cognition&issn=1090-2376&date=2017-03-01&volume=49&issue=&spage=322&au=McCarroll%2C+Christopher+Jude&isbn=&jtitle=Consciousness+and+cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28237834&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.concog.2017.01.014; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Looking+the+past+in+the+eye%3A+Distortion+in+memory+and+the+costs+and+benefits+of+recalling+from+an+observer+perspective&title=Consciousness+and+Cognition%3A+An+International+Journal&issn=10538100&date=2017-03-01&volume=49&issue=&spage=322&au=McCarroll%2C+Christopher+Jude&isbn=&jtitle=Consciousness+and+Cognition%3A+An+International+Journal&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-12584-029&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.concog.2017.01.014","*Adaptation, Psychological; *Autobiographical memory; *Distorted memory; *Memory reconstruction; *Memory, Episodic; *Mental Recall; *Observer perspective memory; 2343:Learning & Memory; Adaptation, Psychological; article; Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Distorted memory; Human; Humans; Index Medicus; Literature Review; Memory reconstruction; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Observer perspective memory; Prospective Memory; Task; Thinking",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It was based mainly on findings from lesion studies. However, recent episodic memory studies point to a contribution of additional or different brain regions to object and location processing within episodic OLM. To evaluate and update the neurocognitive model of OLM, we therefore conducted a systematic literature search for lesion as well as functional neuroimaging studies contrasting small-space episodic OLM with object memory or location memory. We identified 10 relevant lesion studies and 8 relevant functional neuroimaging studies. We could confirm some of the proposals of the neurocognitive model of OLM, but also differing hypotheses from episodic memory research, about which brain regions are involved in the different subprocesses of small-space episodic OLM. In addition, we were able to identify new brain regions as well as important research gaps.","2017-04","2018-06-18 10:58:38","2018-06-19 10:20:14",NA,"487-519",NA,"4","25",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1826695486; 27267249",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Brain+regions+involved+in+subprocesses+of+small-space+episodic+object-location+memory%3A+a+systematic+review+of+lesion+and+functional+neuroimaging+studies.&title=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&issn=1464-0686&date=2017-04-01&volume=25&issue=4&spage=487&au=Zimmermann%2C+Kathrin%3BEschen%2C+Anne&isbn=&jtitle=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27267249&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09658211.2016.1188965; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211.2016.1188965?needAccess=true; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1826695486?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Brain+regions+involved+in+subprocesses+of+small-space+episodic+object-location+memory%3A+a+systematic+review+of+lesion+and+functional+neuroimaging+studies.&title=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&issn=1464-0686&date=2017-04-01&volume=25&issue=4&spage=487&au=Zimmermann%2C+Kathrin%3BEschen%2C+Anne&isbn=&jtitle=Memory+%28Hove%2C+England%29&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27267249&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F09658211.2016.1188965; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Brain+regions+involved+in+subprocesses+of+small-space+episodic+object-location+memory%3A+A+systematic+review+of+lesion+and+functional+neuroimaging+studies&title=Memory&issn=09658211&date=2017-04-01&volume=25&issue=4&spage=487&au=Zimmermann%2C+Kathrin%3BEschen%2C+Anne&isbn=&jtitle=Memory&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-09821-005&rft_id=info:doi/","*Memory, Episodic; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; article; binding; Brain -- physiology; Brain Lesions (Disorders); Brain Mapping; Brain/physiology; episodic memory; Episodic Memory; Form Perception -- physiology; Form Perception/physiology; Functional Neuroimaging -- methods; Functional Neuroimaging/*methods; Human; Humans; Index Medicus; lesion; Literature Review; Memory Disorders; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Neurocognition; neuroimaging; Neuroimaging; Object-location memory; Space Perception -- physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; Systematic Review",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such imagined past events are important aspects of mental life, affecting emotions, decisions, and behaviors. However, studies examining their phenomenological characteristics and content have been few. Here we introduced a new method to systematically compare self-generated episodic counterfactuals to self-generated episodic memories and future projections with regard to their phenomenological characteristics (e.g., imagery, emotional valence, and rehearsal) and content (e.g., reference to a cultural life script), and how these were affected by temporal distance (1 month, 1 year, 5+ years). The findings showed that the three types of events differed phenomenologically. First, episodic memories were remembered more easily, with more sensory details, and from a dominantly field perspective, as compared to both future projections and episodic counterfactuals. Second, episodic future projections were more positive, more voluntarily rehearsed, and more central to life story and identity than were both episodic memories and episodic counterfactuals. Third, episodic counterfactuals differed from both episodic memories and future projections by neither having the positivity bias of the future events nor the enhanced sensory details of the past events. Across all three event types, sensory details decreased, whereas importance, reference to a cultural life script, and centrality increased with increasing temporal distance. The findings show that imagined events are phenomenologically different from memories of experienced events, consistent with reality-monitoring theory, and that imagined future events are different from both actual and imagined past events, consistent with some theories of motivation.","2017-04","2018-06-18 10:58:40","2018-06-19 10:15:55",NA,"375-389",NA,"3","45",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1842599700; 27873188",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13421-016-0671-2.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Imagining+the+personal+past%3A+Episodic+counterfactuals+compared+to+episodic+memories+and+episodic+future+projections.&title=Memory+%26+cognition&issn=1532-5946&date=2017-04-01&volume=45&issue=3&spage=375&au=%C3%96zbek%2C+M%C3%BCge%3BBohn%2C+Annette%3BBerntsen%2C+Dorthe&isbn=&jtitle=Memory+%26+cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27873188&rft_id=info:doi/10.3758%2Fs13421-016-0671-2; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Imagining+the+personal+past%3A+Episodic+counterfactuals+compared+to+episodic+memories+and+episodic+future+projections&title=Memory+%26+Cognition&issn=0090502X&date=2017-04-01&volume=45&issue=3&spage=375&au=%C3%96zbek%2C+M%C3%BCge%3BBohn%2C+Annette%3BBerntsen%2C+Dorthe&isbn=&jtitle=Memory+%26+Cognition&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-57236-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3758%2Fs13421-016-0671-2","*Episodic counterfactuals; *Episodic future projections; *Episodic memory; *Memory, Episodic; *Mental time travel; *Phenomenology; *Temporal distance; 2343:Learning & Memory; Adolescent; Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Cognition; Counterfactual Thinking; Empirical Study; Episodic counterfactuals; Episodic future projections; Episodic memory; Episodic Memory; Female; Future; Human; Humans; Imagination -- physiology; Imagination/*physiology; Index Medicus; Male; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall -- physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Mental time travel; Phenomenology; Quantitative Study; Temporal distance; Turkey; Young Adult; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs)",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the original article, the Highlights section of the article was imprecise. The correct Highlights was present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-42337-026). If hallucinations are not fundamentally different from normal wakeful experiences, then the neural basis of hallucinations has to be essentially that of consciousness in general. The additional insight that consciousness reflects the formation (as opposed to consolidation) of event (episodic) memories links the pathophysiology of hallucinations to the hippocampus. Perceptions and misperceptions, insofar as they are consciously experienced, constitute contextualized and unitary phenomena (which are embedded as discrete events in the stream of consciousness); they are experiential manifestations of activity patters that recurrently emerge in the CA3 network of the hippocampus (and that are secondarily consolidated into retrievable and declarable memories). The hippocampus, forming allocentric representations of objects in their world context (event memories), is a point of convergence of neocortical sensory processing streams. Moreover, being extensively modulated by the organism's physiological state, the hippocampus embeds such representations in an emotional context and, through its output to the medial prefrontal cortex, guides decision-making and goal-selection processes. Although sensory and associative processing in the neocortex makes an important contribution to the formation of behaviourally adaptive representations in the hippocampus, it is becoming clearer that pattern formation in the hippocampus is in itself the neural correlate of consciousness and that disruptions in relational memory processing in the hippocampus can give rise to hallucinations. Neurobiological and neuroimaging findings in schizophrenia research can be integrated within the proposed conceptual framework.

While deficits in autobiographical memory are well-established in autism, few studies have focused on adolescence; a critical period for the developing self and self-esteem. Method: 16 adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 16 typically developing adolescent controls matched for IQ and gender, were asked to provide three self-defining and three everyday memories. Participants rated their memories for emotional intensity, visual perspective and the extent to which they were self-revealing. Memories were independently rated as self-defining or everyday experiences, and according to their valence and theme. Self-esteem and depressed mood were further assessed with self-report questionnaires. Results: There were no group differences in the ability to recognise self-defining memories as assessed by independent reports. Both groups also reported their self-defining memories to be more intense than their everyday memories. However adolescents with ASD, in contrast to non-ASD controls, reported self-defining memories to reveal less about them than everyday memories. Relative to controls, they retrieved fewer memories with an achievement theme and more memories with a recreational theme. The control group showed a bias towards retrieving positive rather than negative self-defining memories but the ASD group showed no such tendency. Self-esteem, but not mood was poorer in the ASD group and self-esteem was related to the retrieval of negative self-defining memories. Conclusions: Adolescents with ASD exhibit an instable self-representation; they recognise the types of past experiences that define them but feel weak connections with these memories.

We argue that space and time serve as a primary scaffold to break up experiences into specific contexts, and to organize multimodal input that is to be associated within a context. However, the hippocampus is clearly capable of incorporating additional dimensions into the scaffold if they are determined to be relevant in the event-defined context.

In this study, we contrasted the effects of these remembering approaches on retrieving real-world navigated routes, the impact on flexibly using familiar route information and on learning new spatial representations. In a within-subjects design, participants were oriented to recall familiar routes under two remembering conditions-a detail condition that promoted episodic memory processes and a gist condition in which routes were recalled via schematic processes. In each condition, participants performed two subsequent navigation tasks. They first described solutions to navigation problems that involved the recalled familiar route (e.g., navigating around a road block or to a new destination) andÂ then learned and recalled a route within a novel spatial environment. All navigation descriptions were scored for the number of spatial references, entities, and sensory descriptions. We report the following findings.Â First, when describing the familiar routes, more details were generated in the detail condition, but a higher proportion of these details were spatial references in the gist condition. Route descriptions in the gist condition also relied more on egocentric spatial representations than in the detail condition. Next, when solving navigation problems in the familiar environment, solution routes were described with more details in the detail condition and deviated less from the familiar route than in the gist condition. Finally, the detail condition led to the preferential encoding of entity and sensory descriptive details of new spatial representations. These findings suggest that activating episodic processes at retrieval has distinct effects on how familiar information can be flexibly used and how new spatial representations are formed.","2017-06-23","2018-06-18 10:58:56","2018-06-19 10:18:11",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1913394914; 28646363",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+many+routes+of+mental+navigation%3A+contrasting+the+effects+of+a+detailed+and+gist+retrieval+approach+on+using+and+forming+spatial+representations.&title=Psychological+research&issn=1430-2772&date=2017-06-23&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Sheldon%2C+Signy%3BRuel%2C+Alexa&isbn=&jtitle=Psychological+research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28646363&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00426-017-0882-6; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1913394914?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+many+routes+of+mental+navigation%3A+contrasting+the+effects+of+a+detailed+and+gist+retrieval+approach+on+using+and+forming+spatial+representations.&title=Psychological+research&issn=1430-2772&date=2017-06-23&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Sheldon%2C+Signy%3BRuel%2C+Alexa&isbn=&jtitle=Psychological+research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28646363&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00426-017-0882-6; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=The+many+routes+of+mental+navigation%3A+Contrasting+the+effects+of+a+detailed+and+gist+retrieval+approach+on+using+and+forming+spatial+representations&title=Psychological+Research&issn=03400727&date=2017-06-23&volume=&issue=&spage=No+Pagination+Specified&au=Sheldon%2C+Signy%3BRuel%2C+Alexa&isbn=&jtitle=Psychological+Research&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-28175-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00426-017-0882-6","2300:Human Experimental Psychology; article; No terms assigned",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These constructs are thought to play important protective roles in models of psychopathology, and several common therapeutic interventions include techniques to increase levels of defusion and decentering. However, little research has examined the construct validity or the underlying structure of measures of these constructs. Across 4 samplesâ€”3 unselected student samples and 1 clinical sampleâ€”we examined 5 self-report measures of defusion/decentering. We found that measures of decentering and defusion were only weakly to modestly associated with each other. Item-level analyses revealed a 2-factor structure, consisting of â€œObserver Perspectiveâ€ and â€œReduced Struggle with Inner Experience,â€ which generally showed expected and distinct patterns of convergent and discriminant validity, although the latter factor had questionable discriminant validity namely a-namely indices of psychological distress (e.g., neuroticism, negative affect, internalizing symptoms, rumination). The factors also related differently to believability of positive versus negative thoughts, which was partially explained by the overrepresentation of negative items in the measures. Implications for the structure and validity of these constructs, as well as for their assessment and use in clinical settings, are discussed.

Using focal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and a social cognitive battery with differing demands on self-other processing, we demonstrate specific involvement of the dmPFC in tasks placing high demands on self-other processing. Specifically, excitatory (anodal) HD-tDCS enhanced the integration of external information into the self for explicit higher-order socio-cognitive tasks across cognitive domains; i.e. visual perspective taking (VPT) and episodic memory. These effects were task specific, as no stimulation effects were found for attributing mental states from the eyes or implicit VPT. Inhibitory (cathodal) HD-tDCS had weaker effects in the opposite direction towards reduced integration of external information into the self. We thus demonstrate for the first time a specific and causal role of the dmPFC in integrating higher-order information from others/external source into that of the self across cognitive domains.","2017-08-01","2018-06-18 10:59:07","2018-06-19 10:14:42",NA,"1209-1218",NA,"8","12",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1892334295; 28444345",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Causal+evidence+for+task-specific+involvement+of+the+dorsomedial+prefrontal+cortex+in+human+social+cognition.&title=Social+cognitive+and+affective+neuroscience&issn=1749-5024&date=2017-08-01&volume=12&issue=8&spage=1209&au=Martin%2C+Andrew+K%3BDzafic%2C+Ilvana%3BRamdave%2C+Swathi%3BMeinzer%2C+Marcus&isbn=&jtitle=Social+cognitive+and+affective+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28444345&rft_id=info:doi/10.1093%2Fscan%2Fnsx063; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1892334295?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Causal+evidence+for+task-specific+involvement+of+the+dorsomedial+prefrontal+cortex+in+human+social+cognition.&title=Social+cognitive+and+affective+neuroscience&issn=1749-5024&date=2017-08-01&volume=12&issue=8&spage=1209&au=Martin%2C+Andrew+K%3BDzafic%2C+Ilvana%3BRamdave%2C+Swathi%3BMeinzer%2C+Marcus&isbn=&jtitle=Social+cognitive+and+affective+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28444345&rft_id=info:doi/10.1093%2Fscan%2Fnsx063; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Causal+evidence+for+task-specific+involvement+of+the+dorsomedial+prefrontal+cortex+in+human+social+cognition&title=Social+Cognitive+and+Affective+Neuroscience&issn=17495016&date=2017-08-01&volume=12&issue=8&spage=1209&au=Martin%2C+Andrew+K.%3BDzafic%2C+Ilvana%3BRamdave%2C+Swathi%3BMeinzer%2C+Marcus&isbn=&jtitle=Social+Cognitive+and+Affective+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-49461-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1093%2Fscan%2Fnsx063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5597860/pdf/nsx063.pdf","*Social Perception; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Adolescent; Adult; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Female; high definition tDCS; Human; Humans; Index Medicus; Male; perspective-taking; Prefrontal Cortex; Prefrontal Cortex -- physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology; Quantitative Study; Role Taking; self-other processing; self-reference effect; Social Perception; theory of mind; Theory of Mind; Theory of Mind -- physiology; Theory of Mind/*physiology; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation -- methods; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation/*methods; Young Adult; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs)",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Combining cellular Ca2+ imaging in RSC of mice with a head-fixed locomotion assay, we identified a population of RSC neurons, located predominantly in superficial layers, whose ensemble activity closely resembles that of hippocampal CA1 place cells during the same task. Like CA1 place cells, these RSC neurons fire in sequences during movement, and show narrowly tuned firing fields that form a sparse, orthogonal code correlated with location. RSC 'place' cell activity is robust to environmental manipulations, showing partial remapping similar to that observed in CA1. This population code for spatial context may assist the RSC in its role in memory and/or navigation.Neurons in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) encode spatial and navigational signals.

Faw and Faw proceed from the well-established notion that conscious experience is a subjective phenomenon and not a depiction of objective (material) reality and not even a reconstitution of inputs from the senses. However, Faw and Faw propose that this latter feedback pathway gives rise to conscious experience of newly formed or recalled memories. Moreover, information represented in higher-order neocortical sensory-processing areas is more suitable for interaction with the environment (egocentric action-oriented representations) than for inclusion, as facets, into an allocentric image of the world. The question should be permitted as to why we feel we have to implicate neocortical areas in the generation of consciousness. If the hippocampus is an â€˜experience simulator,â€™ then why do we have to maintain that conscious experience arises from neocortical activity? This question does not seem to be answered by Faw and Faw, and an answer to it has long been elusive. The more general question as to how consciousness can arise from physical (neuronal) processes is left unanswered, too. Consciousness is not necessary for responding to the world, as Faw and Faw clearly show, but the neural patterns underpinning consciousness (the attractor states in CA3) are nevertheless pertinent to behavior, not to the responding to individual stimuli but to the adjustment of the organismâ€™s behavior to the location or situation in which it finds itself.

We have previously shown a similar behavioral dissociation in nonhuman primates. Hippocampal lesion in adult monkeys prevents allocentric spatial relational learning, whereas spatial learning persists following neonatal lesion. Here, we quantified the number of cells expressing the immediate-early gene c-fos, a marker of neuronal activity, to characterize the functional organization of the medial temporal lobe memory system following neonatal hippocampal lesion. Ninety minutes before brain collection, three control and four adult monkeys with bilateral neonatal hippocampal lesions explored a novel environment to activate brain structures involved in spatial learning. Three other adult monkeys with neonatal hippocampal lesions remained in their housing quarters. In unlesioned monkeys, we found high levels of c-fos expression in the intermediate and caudal regions of the entorhinal cortex, and in the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and retrosplenial cortices. In lesioned monkeys, spatial exploration induced an increase in c-fos expression in the intermediate field of the entorhinal cortex, the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and retrosplenial cortices, but not in the caudal entorhinal cortex. These findings suggest that different regions of the medial temporal lobe memory system may require different types of interaction with the hippocampus in support of memory. The caudal perirhinal cortex, the parahippocampal cortex, and the retrosplenial cortex may contribute to spatial learning in the absence of functional hippocampal circuits, whereas the caudal entorhinal cortex may require hippocampal output to support spatial learning.","2017-12","2018-06-18 10:59:15","2018-06-18 12:32:30",NA,"3899-3914",NA,"9","222",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1899105282; 28488186",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Functional+organization+of+the+medial+temporal+lobe+memory+system+following+neonatal+hippocampal+lesion+in+rhesus+monkeys.&title=Brain+structure+%26+function&issn=1863-2661&date=2017-12-01&volume=222&issue=9&spage=3899&au=Chareyron%2C+Lo%C3%AFc+J%3BBanta+Lavenex%2C+Pamela%3BAmaral%2C+David+G%3BLavenex%2C+Pierre&isbn=&jtitle=Brain+structure+%26+function&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28488186&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00429-017-1441-z; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1899105282?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Functional+organization+of+the+medial+temporal+lobe+memory+system+following+neonatal+hippocampal+lesion+in+rhesus+monkeys.&title=Brain+structure+%26+function&issn=1863-2661&date=2017-12-01&volume=222&issue=9&spage=3899&au=Chareyron%2C+Lo%C3%AFc+J%3BBanta+Lavenex%2C+Pamela%3BAmaral%2C+David+G%3BLavenex%2C+Pierre&isbn=&jtitle=Brain+structure+%26+function&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28488186&rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs00429-017-1441-z","Hippocampus; Cingulate; Entorhinal; Parahippocampal; Perirhinal; Retrosplenial",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The assumptions of much of the literature on human spatial navigation are that 1) spatial navigation involves modality independent, discrete metric representations (i.e., egocentric vs. allocentric), 2) such representations can be further distilled to elemental cognitive processes, and 3) these cognitive processes can be ascribed to unique brain regions. We argue that modality-independent spatial representations, instead of providing exact metrics about our surrounding environment, more often involve heuristics for estimating spatial topology useful to the current task at hand. We also argue that egocentric (body centered) and allocentric (world centered) representations are better conceptualized as involving a continuum rather than as discrete. We propose a neural model to accommodate these ideas, arguing that such representations also involve a continuum of network interactions centered on retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortex, respectively. Our model thus helps explain both behavioral and neural findings otherwise difficult to account for with classic models of spatial navigation and memory, providing a testable framework for novel experiments.","2017-12-01","2018-06-18 10:59:16","2018-06-18 12:34:04",NA,"3328-3344",NA,"6","118",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1941368656; 28931613",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Interacting+networks+of+brain+regions+underlie+human+spatial+navigation%3A+a+review+and+novel+synthesis+of+the+literature.&title=Journal+of+neurophysiology&issn=1522-1598&date=2017-12-01&volume=118&issue=6&spage=3328&au=Ekstrom%2C+Arne+D%3BHuffman%2C+Derek+J%3BStarrett%2C+Michael&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+neurophysiology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28931613&rft_id=info:doi/10.1152%2Fjn.00531.2017; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1941368656?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Interacting+networks+of+brain+regions+underlie+human+spatial+navigation%3A+a+review+and+novel+synthesis+of+the+literature.&title=Journal+of+neurophysiology&issn=1522-1598&date=2017-12-01&volume=118&issue=6&spage=3328&au=Ekstrom%2C+Arne+D%3BHuffman%2C+Derek+J%3BStarrett%2C+Michael&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+neurophysiology&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28931613&rft_id=info:doi/10.1152%2Fjn.00531.2017","episodic memory; cognitive map; hippocampus; path integration; allocentric; spatial navigation; retrosplenial cortex; egocentric; humans",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A novel theoretical framework, the Precision and Binding Model, accounts for these phenomenon by describing a role for the hippocampus in high-resolution, complex binding. Other theories like Cognitive Map Theory, in contrast, predict a specific role for the hippocampus in allocentric navigation, while Declarative Memory Theory predicts a specific role in delay-dependent conscious memory. Navigation provides a unique venue for testing these predictions, with past results from research with humans providing inconsistent findings regarding the role of the human hippocampus in spatial navigation. Here, we tested five patients with lesions primarily restricted to the hippocampus and those extending out into the surrounding medial temporal lobe cortex on a virtual water maze task. Consistent with the Precision and Binding Model, we found partially intact allocentric memory in all patients, with impairments in the spatial precision of their searches for a hidden target. We found similar impairments at both immediate and delayed testing. Our findings are consistent with the Precision and Binding Model of hippocampal function, arguing for its role across domains in high-resolution, complex binding.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRemembering goal locations in one's environment is a critical skill for survival. How this information is represented in the brain is still not fully understood, but is believed to rely in some capacity on structures in the medial temporal lobe. Contradictory findings from studies of both humans and animals have been difficult to reconcile with regard to the role of the MTL, specifically the hippocampus. By assessing impairments observed during navigation to a goal in patients with medial temporal lobe damage we can better understand the role these structures play in such behavior. Utilizing virtual reality and novel analysis techniques, we have more precisely assessed the impact that medial temporal lobe damage has on spatial memory and navigation.","2018-01","2018-06-18 10:59:18","2018-06-18 12:38:55",NA,"31-41",NA,"1","28",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1937532183; 28888032",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Close+but+no+cigar%3A+Spatial+precision+deficits+following+medial+temporal+lobe+lesions+provide+novel+insight+into+theoretical+models+of+navigation+and+memory.&title=Hippocampus&issn=1098-1063&date=2018-01-01&volume=28&issue=1&spage=31&au=Kolarik%2C+Branden+S%3BBaer%2C+Trevor%3BShahlaie%2C+Kiarash%3BYonelinas%2C+Andrew+P%3BEkstrom%2C+Arne+D&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28888032&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22801; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1937532183?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Close+but+no+cigar%3A+Spatial+precision+deficits+following+medial+temporal+lobe+lesions+provide+novel+insight+into+theoretical+models+of+navigation+and+memory.&title=Hippocampus&issn=1098-1063&date=2018-01-01&volume=28&issue=1&spage=31&au=Kolarik%2C+Branden+S%3BBaer%2C+Trevor%3BShahlaie%2C+Kiarash%3BYonelinas%2C+Andrew+P%3BEkstrom%2C+Arne+D&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28888032&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22801; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Close+but+no+cigar%3A+Spatial+precision+deficits+following+medial+temporal+lobe+lesions+provide+novel+insight+into+theoretical+models+of+navigation+and+memory&title=Hippocampus&issn=10509631&date=2018-01-01&volume=28&issue=1&spage=31&au=Kolarik%2C+Branden+S.%3BBaer%2C+Trevor%3BShahlaie%2C+Kiarash%3BYonelinas%2C+Andrew+P.%3BEkstrom%2C+Arne+D.&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-43606-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22801; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.22801","Male; Human; Amnesia; Hippocampus; Memory; Female; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Temporal Lobe; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); 3297:Neurological Disorders & Brain Damage; Middle Age (40-64 yrs); Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; Brain Imaging; Lesions; Medial Temporal Lobe; Spatial Navigation",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the importance of shape and weight overvaluation symptoms in these disorders underlines the critical role of the experience of the body in the etiology of EDs. This article suggests that the transdiagnostic centrality of these symptoms in individuals with EDs may reflect a deficit in the processing and integration of multisensory bodily representations and signals. Multisensory body integration is a critical cognitive and perceptual process, allowing the individual to protect and extend her/his boundaries at both the homeostatic and psychological levels. To achieve this goal the brain integrates sensory data arriving from real-time multiple sensory modalities and internal bodily information with predictions made using the stored information about the body from conceptual, perceptual, and episodic memory. In this view the emotional, visual, tactile, proprioceptive and interoceptive deficits reported by many authors in individuals with EDs may reflect a broader impairment in multisensory body integration that affects the individual's abilities: (a) to identify the relevant interoceptive signals that predict potential pleasant (or aversive) consequences; and (b) to modify/correct the autobiographical allocentric (observer view) memories of body related events (self-objectified memories). Based on this view, the article also proposes a strategy, based on new technologies (i.e., virtual reality and brain/body stimulation), for using crossmodal associations to reactivate and correct the multisensory body integration processes.","2018","2018-06-18 10:59:22","2018-06-19 10:17:01",NA,"49",NA,"","12",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","2008885702; 29483865",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Altered+Processing+and+Integration+of+Multisensory+Bodily+Representations+and+Signals+in+Eating+Disorders%3A+A+Possible+Path+Toward+the+Understanding+of+Their+Underlying+Causes.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2018-01-01&volume=12&issue=&spage=49&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe%3BDakanalis%2C+Antonios&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/29483865&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2018.00049; https://search.proquest.com/docview/2008885702?accountid=14182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5816057/pdf/fnhum-12-00049.pdf; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Altered+Processing+and+Integration+of+Multisensory+Bodily+Representations+and+Signals+in+Eating+Disorders%3A+A+Possible+Path+Toward+the+Understanding+of+Their+Underlying+Causes.&title=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&issn=16625161&date=2018-01-01&volume=12&issue=&spage=49&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe%3BDakanalis%2C+Antonios&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+human+neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/29483865&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2018.00049; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Altered+processing+and+integration+of+multisensory+bodily+representations+and+signals+in+eating+disorders%3A+A+possible+path+toward+the+understanding+of+their+underlying+causes&title=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&issn=1662-5161&date=2018-02-12&volume=12&issue=&spage=&au=Riva%2C+Giuseppe%3BDakanalis%2C+Antonios&isbn=&jtitle=Frontiers+in+Human+Neuroscience&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2018-07355-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.3389%2Ffnhum.2018.00049","3260:Eating Disorders; article; body dissatisfaction; body memory; body representations; eating disorders; Eating Disorders; Episodic Memory; Etiology; Human; interoception; multisensory body integration; self-objectification; Symptoms; virtual reality",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent research has suggested that ACEs arising during spatial memory retrieval are additionally modulated by individual differences in how experienced participants are with a college campus environment. However, the extent and nature of experience with a real-world environment is difficult to assess and control, and characteristics of the retrieval task itself might modulate ACEs during spatial memory retrieval. The present study provides a more controlled and in-depth examination of how individual differences and task-based factors interact to shape ACEs when participants retrieve spatial memories. In two experiments, participants with varied video game experience learned a virtual environment and then used the computer mouse to verify spatial relationships from different perspectives. Mouse trajectories demonstrated ACEs, differing by retrieval perspective and video game experience. Videogame experts demonstrated the ACE based on learned spatial relationships during egocentric retrieval only, whereas videogame novices showed the ACE based on semantic processing of directional terms only. Specifically, gaming experts invoke perspective-specific perceptuo-motor associations to retrieve spatial knowledge, whereas non-experts are influenced by semantically based associations specific to the retrieval task.

Taken together, these findings show a pattern of systematic differences that mark out IFAMs, and they also show that IFAMs can be identified indirectly by lowered performance on concurrent tasks that increase cognitive load.","2018-02","2018-06-18 10:59:29","2018-06-18 12:38:31",NA,"449-454",NA,"2","71",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1835683432; 27788629",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Intentionally+fabricated+autobiographical+memories.&title=Quarterly+journal+of+experimental+psychology+%282006%29&issn=1747-0226&date=2018-02-01&volume=71&issue=2&spage=449&au=Justice%2C+Lucy+V%3BMorrison%2C+Catriona+M%3BConway%2C+Martin+A&isbn=&jtitle=Quarterly+journal+of+experimental+psychology+%282006%29&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27788629&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F17470218.2016.1254262; http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17470218.2016.1254262; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835683432?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Intentionally+fabricated+autobiographical+memories.&title=Quarterly+journal+of+experimental+psychology+%282006%29&issn=1747-0226&date=2018-02-01&volume=71&issue=2&spage=449&au=Justice%2C+Lucy+V%3BMorrison%2C+Catriona+M%3BConway%2C+Martin+A&isbn=&jtitle=Quarterly+journal+of+experimental+psychology+%282006%29&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27788629&rft_id=info:doi/10.1080%2F17470218.2016.1254262","Autobiographical memory; Memory perspective; Cognitive load; Concurrent tasks; Executive processes; False memories; Linguistic analysis",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Space-based theories of memory, including cognitive map and scene construction models, posit that spatial reinstatement is a required process during early event recall. Spatial information can be represented from both allocentric (third-person) and egocentric (first-person) perspectives during EAM, with egocentric perspectives being important for mental imagery and supported by the precuneus. Individuals differ in their tendency to rely on allocentric or egocentric information, and in general, the subjective experience of remembering in EAM differs greatly across individuals. Here we examined individual differences in spatial aspects of EAM, how such differences influence the vividness and temporal order of recollection, and their anatomical correlates. We cued healthy young participants (n =63) with personally familiar locations and non-locations. We examined how cue type affects (i) retrieval dynamics and (ii) phenomenological aspects of remembering, and related behavioural performance to regional brain volumes (n =42). Participants tended to spontaneously recall spatial information early during recollection, even in the absence of spatial cues, and individuals with a stronger tendency to recall space first also displayed faster reaction times. Across participants, place-cued memories were re-experienced more vividly and were richer in detail than those cued by objects, but not more than those cued by familiar persons. Volumetric differences were associated with behavioural performance such that egocentric remembering was positively associated with precuneus volume. Hippocampal CA2/CA3 volumes were associated with the tendency to recall place-cued memories less effortfully. Consistent with scene construction theories, this study suggests that spatial information is reinstated early and contributes to the efficiency and phenomenology of EAM. However, early recall of spatial information is not universal and other routes to recall exist, challenging some aspects of these models. Variability among participants highlights the importance of an individual differences approach to studying EAM.","2018-02","2018-06-18 10:59:31","2018-06-18 12:37:16",NA,"123-133",NA,"","110",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1883842583; 28365362",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S002839321730115X/1-s2.0-S002839321730115X-main.pdf?_tid=fa86b4e8-0b43-48eb-a70e-1bd395339058&acdnat=1529061482_665c75a20a79844563819b23dc142e8b; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+precuneus+and+hippocampus+contribute+to+individual+differences+in+the+unfolding+of+spatial+representations+during+episodic+autobiographical+memory.&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=1873-3514&date=2018-02-01&volume=110&issue=&spage=123&au=Hebscher%2C+Melissa%3BLevine%2C+Brian%3BGilboa%2C+Asaf&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28365362&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2017.03.029; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883842583?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+precuneus+and+hippocampus+contribute+to+individual+differences+in+the+unfolding+of+spatial+representations+during+episodic+autobiographical+memory.&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=1873-3514&date=2018-02-01&volume=110&issue=&spage=123&au=Hebscher%2C+Melissa%3BLevine%2C+Brian%3BGilboa%2C+Asaf&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28365362&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2017.03.029; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=The+precuneus+and+hippocampus+contribute+to+individual+differences+in+the+unfolding+of+spatial+representations+during+episodic+autobiographical+memory&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=00283932&date=2018-02-01&volume=110&issue=&spage=123&au=Hebscher%2C+Melissa%3BLevine%2C+Brian%3BGilboa%2C+Asaf&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-16038-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2017.03.029","Male; Individual Differences; Human; Hippocampus; Precuneus; Female; autobiographical memory; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; Empirical Study; Autobiographical Memory; 2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Young Adulthood (18-29 yrs); Spatial Ability; Thirties (30-39 yrs); Quantitative Study; spatial representations; hippocampus; Brain Imaging; individual differences; Interview; Episodic autobiographical memory; Individual differences; Scene construction; Experimental Replication",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, previous functional neuroimaging studies showing differences in remembering and episodic simulation have focused on veridical retrieval of past experiences, and thus have not fully considered how retrieving the past in different ways from how it was originally experienced may also place similar demands on constructive processes. Here we examined how alternative versions of the past are constructed when adopting different egocentric perspectives during autobiographical memory retrieval compared to simulating hypothetical events from the personal past that could have occurred, or episodic counterfactual thinking. Participants were asked to generate titles for specific autobiographical memories from the last five years, and then, during functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) scanning, were asked to repeatedly retrieve autobiographical memories or imagine counterfactual events cued by the titles. We used an fMRI adaptation paradigm in order to isolate neural regions that were sensitive to adopting alternative egocentric perspectives and counterfactual simulations of the personal past. The fMRI results revealed that voxels within left posterior inferior parietal and ventrolateral frontal cortices were sensitive to novel visual perspectives and counterfactual simulations. Our findings suggest that the neural regions supporting remembering become more similar to those underlying episodic simulation when we adopt alternative egocentric perspectives of the veridical past.","2018-02","2018-06-18 10:59:35","2018-06-19 10:18:35",NA,"170-179",NA,"","110",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","1912197792; 28633886",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ; ","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0028393217302270/1-s2.0-S0028393217302270-main.pdf?_tid=cdf7562f-8c33-4f93-9152-1ca032e4ce35&acdnat=1529061873_6ef4b8374796798c18ad87e170040914; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Remembering+and+imagining+alternative+versions+of+the+personal+past.&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=1873-3514&date=2018-02-01&volume=110&issue=&spage=170&au=St+Jacques%2C+Peggy+L%3BCarpenter%2C+Alexis+C%3BSzpunar%2C+Karl+K%3BSchacter%2C+Daniel+L&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28633886&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2017.06.015; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1912197792?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Remembering+and+imagining+alternative+versions+of+the+personal+past.&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=1873-3514&date=2018-02-01&volume=110&issue=&spage=170&au=St+Jacques%2C+Peggy+L%3BCarpenter%2C+Alexis+C%3BSzpunar%2C+Karl+K%3BSchacter%2C+Daniel+L&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/28633886&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2017.06.015; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Remembering+and+imagining+alternative+versions+of+the+personal+past&title=Neuropsychologia&issn=00283932&date=2018-02-01&volume=110&issue=&spage=170&au=St.+Jacques%2C+Peggy+L.%3BCarpenter%2C+Alexis+C.%3BSzpunar%2C+Karl+K.%3BSchacter%2C+Daniel+L.&isbn=&jtitle=Neuropsychologia&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2017-28244-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.neuropsychologia.2017.06.015","2520:Neuropsychology & Neurology; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); article; autobiographical memory; Autobiographical memory; Autobiographical Memory; Brain Imaging; Construction; Empirical Study; Episodic counterfactual simulation; Experimental Replication; Female; fMRI; Followup Study; Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Human; imagination; Imagination; Linear Perspective; Male; Precuneus; Quantitative Study; Retrieval; visual perspective; Visual perspective",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, recent evidence has linked these retrieval-related effects of visual perspective to subsequent changes in memories. Here we examine how shifting visual perspective influences the accuracy of subsequent memories for complex events encoded in the lab. Participants performed a series of mini-events that were experienced from their own eyes, and were later asked to retrieve memories for these events while maintaining the own eyes perspective or shifting to an alternative observer perspective. We then examined how shifting perspective during retrieval modified memories by influencing the accuracy of recall on a final memory test. Across two experiments, we found that shifting visual perspective reduced the accuracy of subsequent memories and that reductions in vividness when shifting visual perspective during retrieval predicted these changes in the accuracy of memories.

Episodic memory requires the rapid formation and flexible retrieval of where things are located in space. Consciousness of the encoding scene is considered crucial for episodic memory formation. Here, we question the necessity of consciousness and hypothesize that humans can form unconscious episodic memories. Participants were presented with subliminal scenes, that is, scenes invisible to the conscious mind. The scenes displayed objects at certain locations for participants to form unconscious object-in-space memories. Later, the same scenes were presented supraliminally, that is, visibly, for retrieval testing. Scenes were presented absent the objects and rotated by 90Â°-270Â° in perspective to assess the representational flexibility of unconsciously formed memories. During the test phase, participants performed a forced-choice task that required them to place an object in one of two highlighted scene locations and their eye movements were recorded. Evaluation of the eye tracking data revealed that participants remembered object locations unconsciously, irrespective of changes in viewing perspective. This effect of gaze was related to correct placements of objects in scenes, and an intuitive decision style was necessary for unconscious memories to influence intentional behavior to a significant degree. We conclude that conscious perception is not mandatory for spatial episodic memory formation.","2018-04-27","2018-06-18 10:59:43","2018-06-19 10:20:04",NA,"",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","MEDLINEÂ®","2032413472; 29704287",NA,NA,"",NA,"; ; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Subliminal+encoding+and+flexible+retrieval+of+objects+in+scenes.&title=Hippocampus&issn=1098-1063&date=2018-04-27&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Wuethrich%2C+Sergej%3BHannula%2C+Deborah+E%3BMast%2C+Fred+W%3BHenke%2C+Katharina&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/29704287&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22957; https://search.proquest.com/docview/2032413472?accountid=14182; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Subliminal+encoding+and+flexible+retrieval+of+objects+in+scenes.&title=Hippocampus&issn=1098-1063&date=2018-04-27&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Wuethrich%2C+Sergej%3BHannula%2C+Deborah+E%3BMast%2C+Fred+W%3BHenke%2C+Katharina&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/29704287&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22957; http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Subliminal+encoding+and+flexible+retrieval+of+objects+in+scenes&title=Hippocampus&issn=10509631&date=2018-05-17&volume=&issue=&spage=No+Pagination+Specified&au=Wuethrich%2C+Sergej%3BHannula%2C+Deborah+E.%3BMast%2C+Fred+W.%3BHenke%2C+Katharina&isbn=&jtitle=Hippocampus&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2018-23825-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fhipo.22957","2500:Physiological Psychology & Neuroscience; allocentric; article; consciousness; episodic memory; long-term retention; longâ€term retention; No terms assigned; unconscious",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For example, time-based control has been found in rats only when tested in a T-maze apparatus and under specific conditions in which position and orientation (i.e., egocentric) cues during the intertrial interval could not be used to aid performance. Other research in an operant setting has shown that rats often produce minimal errors around the reversal location, demonstrating response patterns similar to patterns exhibited by humans and primates in this task. The current study aimed to reduce, but not eliminate, the ability for rats to utilize egocentric cues by placing the response levers on the opposite wall of the chamber in relation to the pellet dispenser. Results showed that rats made minimal errors prior to the reversal, suggesting time-based cues were not controlling responses, and that they switched to the second correct stimulus within a few trials after the reversal event. Video recordings also revealed highly structured patterns of behavior by the majority of rats, which often differed depending on which response was reinforced. We interpret these findings as evidence that rats are adept at utilizing their own egocentric cues and that these cues, along with memory for the recent response-reinforcement contingencies, aid in maximizing reinforcement  over the session.","2018-07","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:16:23",NA,"10-17",NA,"","152",NA,"Behav Processes",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In most patients neglect involves the left side of space, contralateral to a right-hemispheric lesion. About 50% of stroke patients exhibit neglect in the acute phase. Patients fail to orient, respond to, and report sensory events occurring in the contralateral sides of space and of the body, to explore these portions of space through movements by action effectors (eye, limbs), and to move the contralateral limbs. Neglect is a  multicomponent higher-level disorder of spatial awareness, cognition, and attention. Spatial neglect may occur independently of elementary sensory and motor neurologic deficits, but it can mimic and make them more severe. Diagnostic tests include: motor exploratory target cancellation; setting the midpoint of a horizontal line (bisection), that requires the estimation of lateral extent; drawing by copy and from memory; reading, assessing neglect dyslexia; and exploring the side of the body contralateral to the lesion. Activities of daily living scales are also used. Patients are typically not aware of neglect, although they may exhibit varying degrees of awareness toward different components of the deficit. The neural correlates include lesions to the inferior  parietal lobule of the posterior parietal cortex, which was long considered the unique neuropathologic correlate of neglect, to the premotor and to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, to the posterior superior temporal gyrus, at the temporoparietal junction, to subcortical gray nuclei (thalamus, basal ganglia), and to parietofrontal white-matter fiber tracts, such as the superior longitudinal fascicle. Damage to the inferior parietal lobule of the posterior parietal cortex is specifically associated with the mainly egocentric, perceptual, and exploratory extrapersonal, and with the personal, bodily components of neglect. Productive manifestations, such as perseveration, are not  a correlate of posterior parietal cortex damage.","2018","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:19:19",NA,"287-312",NA,"","151",NA,"Handb Clin Neurol",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated this using a slow event-related fMRI paradigm, based on our previous behavioural finding that  the allocentric-to-egocentric (Allo-Ego) conversion for reach is performed at the first possible opportunity. Participants were asked to remember (and eventually reach towards) the location of a briefly presented target relative to another visual landmark. After a first memory delay, participants were forewarned by a verbal instruction if the landmark would reappear at the same location (potentially allowing them to plan a reach following the auditory cue before the  second delay), or at a different location where they had to wait for the final landmark to be presented before response, and then reach towards the remembered target location. As predicted, participants showed landmark-centred directional selectivity in occipital-temporal cortex during the first memory delay, and only  developed egocentric directional selectivity in occipital-parietal cortex during  the second delay for the 'Same cue' task, and during response for the 'Different  cue' task. We then compared cortical activation between these two tasks at the times when the Allo-Ego conversion occurred, and found common activation in right precuneus, right presupplementary area and bilateral dorsal premotor cortex. These results confirm that the brain converts allocentric codes to egocentric plans at the first possible opportunity, and identify the four most likely candidate sites specific to the Allo-Ego transformation for reaches.","2018-04","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:32:41",NA,"901-917",NA,"8","47",NA,"Eur J Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","(c) 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 29512943",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ejn.13885","Allo-to-Ego conversion; allocentric coding; functional MRI; reaching visual target",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In comparison to egocentric mechanisms, very little is known about such a landmark-centered representation. Here, we used an event-related fMRI design to identify brain areas supporting these two types of spatial coding (i.e., landmark-centered vs. gaze-centered) for target memory during the Delay phase where only target location, not saccade direction, was specified. The paradigm included three tasks with identical display of visual stimuli but different auditory instructions: Landmark Saccade (remember target location relative to a visual landmark, independent of gaze), Control Saccade (remember original target location relative to gaze fixation, independent of the landmark), and a non-spatial control, Color  Report (report target color). During the Delay phase, the Control and Landmark Saccade tasks activated overlapping areas in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and  frontal cortex as compared to the color control, but with higher activation in PPC for target coding in the Control Saccade task and higher activation in temporal and occipital cortex for target coding in Landmark Saccade task. Gaze-centered directional selectivity was observed in superior occipital gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus, whereas landmark-centered directional selectivity was observed in precuneus and midposterior intraparietal sulcus. During the Response phase after saccade direction was specified, the parietofrontal network  in the left hemisphere showed higher activation for rightward than leftward saccades. Our results suggest that cortical activation for coding saccade target  direction relative to a visual landmark differs from gaze-centered directional selectivity for target memory, from the mechanisms for other types of allocentric tasks, and from the directionally selective mechanisms for saccade planning and execution.","2017","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:32:43",NA,"44",NA,"","11",NA,"Front Syst Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 28690501  PMCID: PMC5481872",NA,"","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5481872/pdf/fnsys-11-00044.pdf","fMRI; directional selectivity; gaze-centered coding; landmark-centered coding; saccade",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some have argued that a third-person perspective serves as a coping mechanism allowing the person to distance themselves from details of painful memories. The study reported here created first- and third-person memories in a novel experimental paradigm. Later, participants discriminated between these perspectives on a source memory test while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Experimental evidence from the current study suggests that  memories from different perspectives can be effectively modeled in the lab. Directly comparing first-person and third-person memories revealed no strong source memory or ERP differences; however, more first-person memories were recognized. Surprisingly, the modeling of the behavioral data using ROC curves and Dual Process Signal Detection (DPSD) measures of recollection and familiarity suggest that familiarity contributed to source judgments of both first- and third-person memories. The ERP data support this claim because the putative ERP correlate of familiarity (i.e., FN400) was observed during the source test. Because source monitoring tends to draw on recollection, evidence of familiarity-based source monitoring has been elusive, and these results support a key prediction of the Source Monitoring Framework (SMF) - that source decisions can be based on familiarity in some contexts (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993; Mitchell & Johnson, 2009).","2017-06","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:14:04",NA,"157-168",NA,"","91",NA,"Cortex",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, we hypothesize that a break in the interaction between different spatial representations, as we suggest occurs in AD, may contribute significantly both to the early impairments in spatial and  episodic memory, and to a deficient self-awareness since it may interfere with the capacity of the brain to detect predictive errors.","2017","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:18:08",NA,"881-892",NA,"3","55",NA,"J Alzheimers Dis",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 27767990",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=The+Proactive+Self+in+Space%3A+How%C2%A0Egocentric+and+Allocentric+Spatial+Impairments+Contribute+to+Anosognosia+in%C2%A0Alzheimer%27s+Disease.&title=Journal+of+Alzheimer%27s+disease+%3A+JAD&issn=1875-8908&date=2017-01-01&volume=55&issue=3&spage=881&au=Serino%2C+Silvia%3BRiva%2C+Giuseppe&isbn=&jtitle=Journal+of+Alzheimer%27s+disease+%3A+JAD&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/27767990&rft_id=info:doi/; https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835519133?accountid=14182; https://content.iospress.com/download/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad160676?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease%2Fjad160676","Humans; Male; episodic memory; Female; Index Medicus; Neuropsychological Tests; Alzheimer Disease -- complications; Memory, Episodic; Alzheimerâ€™s disease; Agnosia -- etiology; Allocentric reference frame; anosognosia; Awareness -- physiology; egocentric reference frame; *Memory, Episodic; *Allocentric reference frame; *Alzheimer's disease; *anosognosia; *egocentric reference frame; *episodic memory; Agnosia/*etiology; Alzheimer Disease/*complications; Awareness/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This ability requires that a circadian clock provide phase information (a time tag) to cognitive systems involved in linking representations of an event with spatial reference memory. To date, it is unclear which neuronal  substrates are critical in this process, but one candidate structure is the hippocampus (HPC). The HPC is essential for normal performance on tasks that require allocentric spatial memory and exhibits circadian rhythms of gene expression that are sensitive to meal timing. Using a novel TPL training procedure and enriched, multidimensional environment, we trained rats to locate a food reward that varied between two locations relative to time of day. After rats acquired the task, they received either HPC or SHAM lesions and were re-tested. Rats with HPC lesions were initially impaired on the task relative to SHAM rats,  but re-attained high scores with continued testing. Probe tests revealed that the rats were not using an alternation strategy or relying on light-dark transitions  to locate the food reward. We hypothesize that transient disruption and recovery  reflect a switch from HPC-dependent allocentric navigation (learning places) to dorsal striatum-dependent egocentric spatial navigation (learning routes to a location). Whatever the navigation strategy, these results demonstrate that the HPC is not required for rats to find food in different locations using circadian  phase as a discriminative cue.","2016-12","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:33:00",NA,"236-243",NA,"","136",NA,"Neurobiol Learn Mem",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using a conceptual referential communication task, in which participants describe a range of abstract geometric  shapes, Experiment 1 shows that perspective-taking and egocentric communication are frequent communication strategies. Experiment 2 tests a selection heuristic account of perspective-taking and egocentric communication. It uses participants' shape description ratings to predict their communication strategy. Participants'  communication strategy was predicted by how informative they perceived the different shape descriptions to be. When participants' personal shape description was perceived to be more informative than their addressee's shape description, there was a strong bias to communicate egocentrically. By contrast, when their addressee's shape description was perceived to be more informative, there was a strong bias to take their addressee's perspective. When the shape descriptions were perceived to be equally informative, there was a moderate bias to communicate egocentrically. This simple, but powerful, selection heuristic may be critical to the cumulative cultural evolution of human communication systems, and cumulative cultural evolution more generally.","2016","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:17:11",NA,"e0159570",NA,"7","11",NA,"PLoS One",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 27437694  PMCID: PMC4954652",NA,"","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4954652/pdf/pone.0159570.pdf","*Communication; *Cultural Evolution; *Interpersonal Relations; Adult; Behavior; Culture; Female; Humans; Male; Memory/physiology; Somnambulism/*psychology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dual tasks with various cognitive loads seem to be an effective way to assess the automatic deficit hypothesis. AIMS: The aims of the study were: (1) to examine the effect of a concurrent cognitive task on fine and gross motor tasks in children with DCD, and (2) to determine whether the effect varied with different difficulty levels of the concurrent task. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We examined dual-task performance (Trail-Making-Test, Trail-Walking-Test) in 20 children with DCD and 39 typically developing children. Based on the idea of the  Trail-Making-Test, participants walked along a fixed pathway, following a prescribed path, delineated by target markers of (1) increasing sequential numbers, and (2) increasing sequential numbers and letters. The motor and cognitive dual-task effects (DTE) were calculated for each task. RESULTS: Regardless of the cognitive task, children with DCD performed equally well in fine and gross motor tasks, and were slower in the dual task conditions than under single task-conditions, compared with children without DCD. Increased cognitive task complexity resulted in slow trail walking as well as slower trail  tracing. The motor interference for the gross motor tasks was least for the simplest conditions and greatest for the complex conditions and was more pronounced in children with DCD. Cognitive interference was low irrespective of the motor task. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Children with DCD show a different  approach to allocation of cognitive resources, and have difficulties making motor skills automatic. The latter notion is consistent with impaired cerebellar function and the ""automatization deficit hypothesis"", suggesting that any deficit in the automatization process will appear if conscious monitoring of the motor skill is made more difficult by integrating another task requiring attentional resources.","2016-10","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:17:57",NA,"136-148",NA,"","57",NA,"Res Dev Disabil",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, it involves behavioral bias directed ipsilaterally to the damaged hemisphere and loss of spatial awareness for the contralesional side. In this syndrome, several clinical subtypes were identified. The objective  of this article is to provide a nosological analysis of the recent data from the  literature on the different subtypes of neglect (visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor, egocentric, allocentric and representational neglect), associated ipsilesional and contralesional productive manifestations and their anatomical lesion correlates. These different anatomical-clinical subtypes can be associated or dissociated. They reflect the heterogeneity of this unilateral neglect syndrome that cannot be approached or interpreted in a single manner. We propose  that these subtypes result from different underlying deficits: exogenous attentional deficit (visual, auditory neglect); representational deficit (personal neglect, representational neglect, hyperschematia); shift of the egocentric reference frame (egocentric neglect); attentional deficit between objects and within objects (allocentric neglect), endogenous attentional deficit  (representational neglect) and transsaccadic working memory or spatial remapping  deficit (ipsilesional productive manifestations). Taking into account the different facets of the unilateral neglect syndrome should promote the development of more targeted cognitive rehabilitation protocols.","2017-06","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:17:08",NA,"177-185",NA,"3","60",NA,"Ann Phys Rehabil Med",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Previous work suggested impaired spatial navigation in patients with bilateral vestibular failure (BVF). The aim of this study was to investigate event-related brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during spatial navigation and visual memory tasks in BVF patients. METHODS: Twenty-three BVF patients and healthy age- and gender matched control subjects performed learning sessions of spatial navigation by watching short films taking them through various streets from a driver's perspective along a route to the Cathedral of Cologne using virtual reality videos (adopted and modified from Google Earth). In the scanner, participants were asked to respond to questions testing for visual memory or spatial navigation while they viewed short video clips. From a similar but not identical perspective depicted video frames of routes were displayed which they had previously seen or which were completely novel to them. RESULTS: Compared with controls, posterior cerebellar activity in BVF patients was higher during spatial navigation than during visual  memory tasks, in the absence of performance differences. This cerebellar activity correlated with disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar activity during spatial navigation in BVF patients may reflect increased non-vestibular efforts to counteract the development of spatial navigation deficits in BVF. Conceivably, cerebellar activity indicates a change in navigational strategy of BVF patients,  i.e. from a more allocentric, landmark or place-based strategy (hippocampus) to a more sequence-based strategy. This interpretation would be in accord with recent  evidence for a cerebellar role in sequence-based navigation.","2015-10-01","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:38:19",NA,"257-267",NA,"","305",NA,"Neuroscience",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2015 IBRO.

However, empirical evidence linking hippocampal activity to the perceptual experience of being physically located at  a particular place in the environment is lacking. In this study, we used a multisensory out-of-body illusion to perceptually 'teleport' six healthy participants between two different locations in the scanner room during high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants were fitted with MRI-compatible head-mounted displays that changed their first-person visual perspective to that of a pair of cameras placed in one of two corners of the scanner room. To elicit the illusion of being physically located in this position, we delivered synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation in the form  of an object moving toward the cameras coupled with touches applied to the participant's chest. Asynchronous visuo-tactile stimulation did not induce the illusion and served as a control condition. We found that illusory self-location  could be successfully decoded from patterns of activity in the hippocampus in all of the participants in the synchronous (P < 0.05) but not in the asynchronous condition (P > 0.05). At the group-level, the decoding accuracy was significantly higher in the synchronous than in the asynchronous condition (P = 0.012). These findings associate hippocampal activity with the perceived location of the bodily self in space, which suggests that the human hippocampus is involved not only in  spatial navigation and memory but also in the construction of our sense of bodily self-location.","2015","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:35:11",NA,"412",NA,"","9",NA,"Front Hum Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 26236222  PMCID: PMC4502353",NA,"","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26236222","multisensory integration; self-consciousness; body perception; perceptual illusion; self-location",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ability to do this depends on learning and remembering locations. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues and sometimes proximal cues, egocentric navigation. Allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures (e.g., subiculum); in humans this system encodes declarative memory (allocentric, semantic, and episodic, i.e., memory for people, places, things, and events). This form of memory is assessed in laboratory animals by many methods, but predominantly the Morris water maze (MWM). Egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and when over-learned becomes implicit or procedural memory. Several allocentric methods for rodents are reviewed and compared with the MWM with particular focus on the Cincinnati water maze (CWM). MWM advantages include minimal training, no food deprivation, ease of testing, reliable learning, insensitivity to differences in body weight and appetite, absence of non-performers, control methods for performance effects, repeated testing capability and other factors that make this test well-suited for regulatory studies. MWM limitations are also reviewed. Evidence-based MWM design  and testing methods are presented. On balance, the MWM is arguably the preferred  test for assessing learning and memory in basic research and regulatory studies and the CWM is recommended if two tests can be accommodated so that both allocentric (MWM) and egocentric (CWM) learning and memory can be effectively and efficiently assessed.","2015-12","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:19:37",NA,"93-108",NA,"Pt A","52",NA,"Neurotoxicol Teratol",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to demonstrate that tactile WM representations are stored in modality-specific cortical regions, that the goal-directed modulation of these representations is mediated through hemispheric-specific activation of somatosensory areas, and that the rehearsal of somatotopic coordinates in memory is accomplished by modality-specific spatial attention mechanisms. Participants encoded two tactile sample stimuli presented simultaneously to the left and right hands, before visual retro-cues indicated which of these stimuli had to be retained to be matched with a subsequent test stimulus on the same hand. Retro-cues triggered a sustained tactile contralateral delay activity component with a scalp topography over somatosensory cortex contralateral to the cued hand. Early somatosensory ERP components to task-irrelevant probe stimuli (that were presented after the retro-cues) and to subsequent test stimuli were enhanced when these stimuli appeared at the currently memorized location relative to other locations on the cued hand, demonstrating that a precise focus of spatial attention was established during the selective maintenance of tactile events in WM. These effects were observed regardless of whether participants performed the matching task with uncrossed or  crossed hands, indicating that WM representations in this task were based on somatotopic rather than allocentric spatial coordinates. In conclusion, spatial rehearsal in tactile WM operates within somatotopically organized sensory brain areas that have been recruited for information storage.","2015-01-28","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:38:34",NA,"1390-1395",NA,"4","35",NA,"J Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2015 Katus et al.","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 25632117  PMCID: PMC4308590",NA,"","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4308590/pdf/zns1390.pdf","Adult; Electroencephalography; Humans; Male; Cues; selective attention; working memory; Female; Young Adult; Time Factors; Reaction Time; Evoked Potentials/*physiology; *Brain Mapping; Association Learning/physiology; electroencephalography; event-related potentials; Functional Laterality/physiology; Hand/innervation; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Physical Stimulation; somatosensation; Somatosensory Cortex/*physiology; Touch/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The egocentric distance to stimuli is a powerful determinant of defensive behavior in animals. Yet, little is known about how spatial proximity to others alters defensive responses in humans. We hypothesized that the valence of social  cues scales with egocentric distance, such that proximal social stimuli have more positive or negative valence than distal stimuli. This would predict enhanced defensive responses to proximal threat and reduced defensive responses to proximal reward. We tested this hypothesis across four experiments using 3-D virtual reality simulations. Results from Experiment 1 confirmed that proximal social stimuli facilitate defensive responses, as indexed by fear-potentiated startle, relative to distal stimuli. Experiment 2 revealed that interpersonal defensive boundaries flexibly increase with aversive learning. Experiment 3 examined whether spatial proximity enhances memory for aversive experiences. Fear memories for social threats encroaching on the body were more persistent than those acquired at greater interpersonal distances, as indexed by startle. Lastly, Experiment 4 examined how egocentric distance influenced startle responses to social threats during defensive approach and avoidance. Whereas fear-potentiated  startle increased with proximity when participants actively avoided receiving shocks, startle decreased with proximity when participants tolerated shocks to receive monetary rewards, implicating opposing gradients of distance on threat versus reward. Thus, proximity in egocentric space amplifies the valence of social stimuli that, in turn, facilitates emotional memory and approach-avoidance responses. These findings have implications for understanding the consequences of increased urbanization on affective interpersonal behavior.","2015-04","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:25:56",NA,"476-485",NA,"","70",NA,"Neuropsychologia",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Cortical mechanisms for egocentric reach are relatively well described, but the corresponding allocentric representations are  essentially unknown. Here, we used an event-related fMRI design to distinguish human brain areas involved in these two types of representation. Our paradigm consisted of three tasks with identical stimulus display but different instructions: egocentric reach (remember absolute target location), allocentric reach (remember target location relative to a visual landmark), and a nonspatial  control, color report (report color of target). During the delay phase (when only target location was specified), the egocentric and allocentric tasks elicited widely overlapping regions of cortical activity (relative to the control), but with higher activation in parietofrontal cortex for egocentric task and higher activation in early visual cortex for allocentric tasks. In addition, egocentric  directional selectivity (target relative to gaze) was observed in the superior occipital gyrus and the inferior occipital gyrus, whereas allocentric directional selectivity (target relative to a visual landmark) was observed in the inferior temporal gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. During the response phase (after movement direction had been specified either by reappearance of the visual landmark or a pro-/anti-reach instruction), the parietofrontal network resumed egocentric directional selectivity, showing higher activation for contralateral than ipsilateral reaches. These results show that allocentric and egocentric reach mechanisms use partially overlapping but different cortical substrates and  that directional specification is different for target memory versus reach response.","2014-09-10","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:32:38",NA,"12515-12526",NA,"37","34",NA,"J Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2014 the authors 0270-6474/14/3412515-12$15.00/0.","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 25209289",NA,"","http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/34/37/12515.full.pdf","Adult; Humans; Male; fMRI; Young Adult; directional selectivity; Spatial Memory/*physiology; Spatial Navigation/*physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; Orientation/*physiology; allocentric reach; Cerebral Cortex/*physiology; egocentric reach; Movement/*physiology; Nerve Net/physiology; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ability to do this depends on learning and remembering locations. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues and sometimes proximal cues, egocentric navigation. Allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures (e.g., subiculum); in humans this system encodes declarative memory (allocentric, semantic, and episodic, i.e., memory for people, places, things, and events). This form of memory is assessed in laboratory animals by many methods, but predominantly the Morris water maze (MWM). Egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and when over-learned becomes implicit or procedural memory. Several allocentric methods for rodents are reviewed and compared with the MWM with particular focus on the Cincinnati water maze (CWM). MWM advantages include minimal training, no food deprivation, ease of testing, reliable learning, insensitivity to differences in body weight and appetite, absence of non-performers, control methods for performance effects, repeated testing capability and other factors that make this test well-suited for regulatory studies. MWM limitations are also reviewed. Evidence-based MWM design  and testing methods are presented. On balance, the MWM is arguably the preferred  test for assessing learning and memory in basic research and regulatory studies and the CWM is recommended if two tests can be accommodated so that both allocentric (MWM) and egocentric (CWM) learning and memory can be effectively and efficiently assessed.","2014-10","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:19:32",NA,"75-90",NA,"","45",NA,"Neurotoxicol Teratol",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The vividness of an episodic future thought largely depends on the familiarity of its constitutive elements (i.e., the envisioned location, persons and objects), while the visual perspective adopted is instead related to the temporal distance of the imagined event. Cognitive feelings such as the sense of pre-experiencing the future depend on sensory-perceptual qualities, and are further modulated by the personal importance attributed to the event. These findings suggest that the essence of episodic future thought-the sensation of mentally visiting one's personal future-lies, in part, in the relevance of imagined events with respect to personal goals.","2012-09","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:33:32",NA,"1198-1206",NA,"3","21",NA,"Conscious Cogn",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that as degenerative brain diseases are ""system pathologies,"" degeneration could be restricted to some of the neural subsystems implicated in the functional organization of spatial attention and different neglect syndromes could emerge depending on the patterns of the subsystems involved. METHOD: We studied five neglect patients: one with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), three with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) and one with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). RESULTS: The patient with CBD and left parietoccipital atrophy showed right allocentric neglect; the three patients with PCA mostly distributed in the right posterior regions showed left egocentric extrapersonal neglect; the patient with FTD, who displayed more severe frontotemporal atrophy on the right, had left motor-executive neglect for both personal and extrapersonal space. All patients also presented a deep breakdown of spatial working memory. CONCLUSION: Our data would confirm that left neglect is more frequent than right neglect also in degenerative pathology and that damage to different neural substrates can produce different types of neglect. Our findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that both lateralized and nonlateralized attention disorders contribute to generate the syndrome. We suggest that evidence from degenerative diseases may contribute to construction of models of spatial attention.","2011-09","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:18:21",NA,"554-566",NA,"5","25",NA,"Neuropsychology",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved.","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 21639641",NA,"","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21639641","*Attention; *Functional Laterality; *Orientation; Aged; Atrophy; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases/*complications/pathology/physiopathology; Neuropsychological Tests; Perceptual Disorders/complications/*diagnosis/pathology/physiopathology; Spatial Behavior",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This explains why  self-change promotes third-person imagery of prechange selves (Studies 1 and 2).  And, the same mechanism determines perspective apart from self-change, in both memory and imagination (Studies 3 and 4). By demonstrating that people shift perspective according to whether they focus on the experience of an event or its  self-concept coherence, these results suggest how perspective may function more broadly in social cognition, and specifically in the construction and maintenance of the temporally extended self.","2011-05","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:14:12",NA,"714-726",NA,"5","37",NA,"Pers Soc Psychol Bull",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 21487115",NA,"","http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167211400207","*Imagery (Psychotherapy); *Mental Recall; *Self Concept; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Motivation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We tested whether schizophrenia patients are able to adopt and maintain a non-egocentric point of view in a complex visual environment. Twenty-four chronic schizophrenic outpatients (11 females) and 25 controls matched for age, gender, years of education and handedness were recruited from a population-based sample. In a virtual environment, participants had to make a decision as to which of two trash cans was closest to themselves (viewer-centered, egocentric), to a ball (object-centered, unstable allocentric), or to a palace (landmark-centered, stable allocentric). Main outcome measures were reaction time, error rate, learning rate and local task switch cost. While egocentric reaction time was preserved, patients showed an increased reaction time in both allocentric referencing conditions (stable and unstable) and an overall increased error rate. Switch cost was diminished in patients when changing from the egocentric to the landmark-centered condition and elevated when changing from the landmark-centered to the egocentric condition. The results imply that schizophrenia patients' adoption of an egocentric perspective is preserved. However, adopting an allocentric point of view and switching between egocentric and landmark-centered  perspectives are impaired.

We predicted that self-projection to the personal past would elicit greater activity in ventral mPFC, whereas self-projection of another perspective would rely on dorsal mPFC. There were three main findings supporting this prediction. First, we found that self-projection to the personal past recruited greater ventral mPFC, whereas observing another person's perspective recruited dorsal mPFC. Second, activity in ventral versus dorsal mPFC was sensitive to parametric modulation on each trial by the ability to relive the personal past or to understand another's perspective, respectively. Third, task-related functional connectivity analysis revealed that ventral mPFC contributed to the medial temporal lobe network linked to memory processes, whereas dorsal mPFC contributed to the fronto-parietal network linked to controlled processes. In sum, these results suggest that ventral-dorsal subregions of the anterior midline are functionally dissociable and may differentially contribute to self-projection of self versus other.","2011-06","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:18:32",NA,"1275-1284",NA,"6","23",NA,"J Cogn Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 20521858  PMCID: PMC3132549",NA,"","https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/jocn.2010.21518","*Projection; *Self Concept; Adult; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation/methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation/*methods; Male; Memory/*physiology; Photic Stimulation/methods; Photography/instrumentation/*methods; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology; Prospective Studies; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Psychophysiology; Space Perception/physiology; Young Adult",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When a rat selects an arm in a plus maze, for example, the choice can be guided by distinct neural systems (White and Wise, 1999) that encode different relationships among perceived stimuli, actions, and reward. Thus, egocentric or stimulus-response associations require striatal circuits, whereas spatial or episodic learning requires hippocampal circuits (Packard et al., 1989). Although these memory systems function in parallel (Packard and McGaugh, 1996), they can also interact competitively or synergistically (Kim and Ragozzino, 2005). The neuronal mechanisms that coordinate these multiple memory systems are not fully known, but converging evidence suggests that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central. The PFC is crucial for abstract, rule-guided behavior in primates and for switching rapidly between  memory strategies in rats. We now report that rat medial PFC neuronal activity predicts switching between hippocampus- and caudate-dependent memory strategies.  Prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) neuronal activity changed as rats switched memory strategies even as the rats performed identical behaviors but did not change when rats learned new contingencies using the same strategy. PL dynamics anticipated learning performance whereas IL lagged, suggesting that the two regions help initiate and establish new strategies, respectively. These neuronal  dynamics suggest that the PFC contributes to the coordination of memory strategies by integrating the predictive relationships among stimuli, actions, and reward.","2009-06-03","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:16:52",NA,"7208-7219",NA,"22","29",NA,"J Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 19494143  PMCID: PMC3229282",NA,"","http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/29/22/7208.full.pdf","Action Potentials/physiology; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Behavior, Animal/physiology; Brain Mapping; Conditioning, Operant/physiology; Discrimination Learning/*physiology; Maze Learning/physiology; Memory/*physiology; Neurons/classification/*physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/*cytology; Rats; Rats, Long-Evans; Spatial Behavior/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The effects of these representations can be dissociated behaviorally, developmentally, and in terms of their neural bases. It is now becoming possible  to construct a mechanistic neural-level model of at least some aspects of spatial memory and imagery, with the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe providing allocentric environmental representations, the parietal lobe egocentric representations, and the retrosplenial cortex and parieto-occipital sulcus allowing both types of representation to interact. Insights from this model include a common mechanism for the construction of spatial scenes in the service  of both imagery and episodic retrieval and a role for the remainder of Papez's circuit in orienting the viewpoint used.

The frontal eye fields may be used when subjects move their internal gaze during shifting reference frames in representational space. Analysis of actual eye movements in three subjects revealed no difference  between egocentric and allocentric recall tasks where visual stimuli were also absent.

Three frames of reference were systematically compared. In experiment 1, participants relocated the objects either from the same position of learning by taking as reference their own body (centred egocentric condition) or from a 90 degrees decentred position (allocentric condition). Performance was measured in terms of linear distance errors and angular distance errors. Results revealed that the allocentric condition was more difficult than the centred egocentric condition. In experiment 2, participants performed either the centred egocentric condition or a decentred egocentric condition, in which the body position during the test was the same as at encoding (egocentric) but the frame of reference was based on a point decentred by 90 degrees. The decentred egocentric condition was found to be more difficult than the centred egocentric condition. Finally, in experiment 3, participants performed in the decentred egocentric condition or the allocentric condition. Here, the allocentric condition was found to be more difficult than the decentred egocentric condition.

In the parietal cortex, distances are thought to be represented with respect to the body (egocentric representation) and in superior temporal cortices with respect to other objects, independent of the observer (allocentric representation). However, these representations of space are interdependent, complicating such distinctions. Specifically, an object's position within a background frame strongly biases egocentric position location judgments. This bias, however, is absent for pointing movements towards  that same object. More recent theories state that dorsal parietal spatial representations subserve visuomotor processing, whereas temporal lobe representations subserve memory and cognition. Therefore, it may be hypothesized  that parietal egocentric representations, responsible for movement control, are not influenced by irrelevant allocentric cues, whereas ventral representations are. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study, subjects judged target bar locations relative to their body (egocentric task) or a background bar (allocentric task). Activity in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) was shown to increase during egocentric judgments, but not during allocentric judgments. The superior temporal gyrus (STG) shows a negative BOLD response during allocentric judgments and no activation during egocentric judgments. During egocentric judgments, the irrelevant background influenced activity in the posterior commissure and the medial temporal gyrus. SPL activity was unaffected by the irrelevant background during egocentric judgments. Sensitivity to spatial  perceptual biases is apparently limited to occipito-temporal areas, subserving the observed biased cognitive reports of location, and is not found in parietal areas, subserving unbiased goal-directed actions.","2006-05-15","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:15:32",NA,"320-331",NA,"1","31",NA,"Neuroimage",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 16473025",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1053811905025358/1-s2.0-S1053811905025358-main.pdf?_tid=fe0db9bd-95cc-4e65-828b-a22cfec380bb&acdnat=1529062089_678206cf38c75dd2fd590ed01940a18e","*Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Adult; Attention/*physiology; Brain Mapping; Distance Perception/*physiology; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Female; Hippocampus/physiology; Humans; Judgment; Male; Nerve Net/physiology; Orientation/*physiology; Oxygen/*blood; Parietal Lobe/*physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; Temporal Lobe/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such preservation may rely, instead, on  a network of dissociable, extra-hippocampal regions implicated in topographical orientation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated  this hypothesis in healthy individuals with extensive experience navigating in a  large-scale urban environment (downtown Toronto). Participants were scanned as they performed mental navigation tasks that emphasized different types of spatial representations. Tasks included proximity judgments, distance judgments, landmark sequencing, and blocked-route problem-solving. The following regions were engaged to varying degrees depending on the processing demands of each task: retrosplenial cortex, believed to be involved in assigning directional significance to locales within a relatively allocentric framework; medial and posterior parietal cortex, concerned with processing space within egocentric coordinates during imagined movement; and regions of prefrontal cortex, present in tasks heavily dependent on working memory. In a second, event-related experiment, a distinct area of inferotemporal cortex was revealed during identification of familiar landmarks relative to unknown buildings in addition to activation of many of those regions identified in the navigation tasks. This result suggests that familiar landmarks are strongly integrated with the spatial  context in which they were experienced. Importantly, right medial temporal lobe activity was observed, its magnitude equivalent across all tasks, though the core of the activated region was in the parahippocampal gyrus, barely touching the hippocampus proper.","2004","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:17:29",NA,"826-835",NA,"7","14",NA,"Hippocampus",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 15382253",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.10218","Adult; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Evoked Potentials/physiology; Hippocampus/*physiology; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory/*physiology; Orientation/*physiology; Space Perception/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In particular, scopolamine-induced impairment in rodents is not task specific, which may be due to difficulty in developing rodent protocols to assess deficits in recent memory, in which the remembered event is brief and distinct, and/or to non-specific behavioral impairment. OBJECTIVES: The present study sought to determine whether scopolamine-induced deficits in recent  memory, using a working memory task, could be dose-specifically dissociated from  deficits in associative memory in dogs. METHODS: A Latin-square design was used to determine the effect of scopolamine (5, 10 and 15 microg/kg; SC) on a variable delayed-non-matching-to-position (DNMP) task, which assesses visuospatial working memory. Subsequently, the minimal effective dose (15 microg/kg; SC) was administered prior to testing on a landmark discrimination task, which provides a measure of allocentric spatial ability, a black-white discrimination task, an oddity discrimination task and tests of exploratory behavior. We also investigated the effects of a 30 microg/kg dose (SC) on tests of oddity discrimination and behavioral activity. RESULTS: A 15 microg/kg dose produced significant impairment on the DNMP task, but did not affect performance of any discrimination task and did not alter behavior on tests of open field or curiosity. A 30 microg/kg dose caused disruption on discrimination performance and on open field measures. CONCLUSIONS: Working memory performance is most sensitive to scopolamine-induced impairment and can be dissociated from scopolamine-induced deficits in discrimination performance and non-cognitive behaviors. The present results indicate that scopolamine-induced impairments of working memory in the dog can serve as a model of age-related cholinergic dysfunction.","2004-08","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:26:06",NA,"92-98",NA,"1","175",NA,"Psychopharmacology (Berl)",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 15029470",NA,"","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00213-004-1777-y.pdf","Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Male; Female; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs; Reward; Aging/psychology; *Muscarinic Antagonists/administration & dosage; *Scopolamine Hydrobromide/administration & dosage; Behavior, Animal/drug effects; Discrimination Learning/*drug effects; Exploratory Behavior/drug effects; Memory Disorders/*chemically induced/psychology; Vision Disorders/*chemically induced/psychology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our results revealed greater delay-epoch activity in egocentric than in allocentric trials in the caudate nucleus and trends in the same direction in the putamen and the lateral premotor cortex (PMC). Response-related activity was greater for egocentric trials in the lateral PMC. We propose that the neostriatum, possibly interacting with the PMC, may contribute to the sensory-motor transformation necessary to establish a prospective motor code (e.g., the representation of a saccade or a grasp). In addition, the PMC may participate in decision-making processes, prompted by the onset of the probe stimulus, that employ this prospective motor information. This model accounts for the empirical evidence that motor distraction disrupts spatial working memory performance.","2003-06","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-19 10:16:13",NA,"133-144",NA,"2","3",NA,"Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 12943328",NA,"","","Adult; Brain Mapping; Caudate Nucleus/*physiology; Evoked Potentials/physiology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Short-Term/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance; Spatial Behavior/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subjects received a set of objects from two different people in two different places within a VR environment. Memory for the objects, and for where and from whom they were received was tested by putting the subject back into a place in the company of a person and giving a paired forced choice of objects. In four conditions objects had to be chosen according to different criteria: which was received in that place, which was received from that person, which object was recognized, and which object was widest. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed during testing to identify areas involved in retrieval of the spatial context of an event. A network of areas was identified consisting of a temporoparietal pathway running between the precuneus and parahippocampi via retrosplenial cortex and the parieto-occipital sulcus, left hippocampus, bilateral posterior parietal, dorsolateral, ventrolateral and anterior prefrontal cortices, and the anterior cingulate. Of these areas the parahippocampal, right posterior parietal, and posteriodorsal medial parietal areas were specifically involved in retrieval of spatial context compared to retrieval of nonspatial context. The posterior activations are consistent with a  model of long-term storage of allocentric representations in medial temporal regions with translation to body-centered and head-centered representations computed in right posterior parietal cortex and buffered in the temporoparietal pathway so as to provide an imageable representation in the precuneus. Prefrontal activations are consistent with strategic retrieval processes, including those required to overcome the interference between the highly similar events.","2001-08","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:29:31",NA,"439-453",NA,"2","14",NA,"Neuroimage",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","Copyright 2001 Academic Press.","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 11467917",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1053811901908067/1-s2.0-S1053811901908067-main.pdf?_tid=5242655c-9d1b-4b96-9e72-f379f50822ec&acdnat=1529061251_91ea0dbd1c72df331776cd851300b2dd","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Brain Mapping; Reference Values; Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology; Mental Recall/*physiology; Visual Perception/*physiology; Parietal Lobe/*physiology; Temporal Lobe/*physiology; *User-Computer Interface; Orientation/*physiology; Parahippocampal Gyrus/physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Gyrus Cinguli/physiology; Nerve Net/*physiology; Retention (Psychology)/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the rat, cells coding for places, directions, and speed of movement have been recorded from the hippocampus proper and/or the neighbouring subicular complex. Place fields of a group of the hippocampal pyramidal cells cover the surface of an environment but do not appear to do so in any systematic  fashion. That is, there is no topographical relation between the anatomical location of the cells within the hippocampus and the place fields of these cells  in an environment. Recent work shows that place cells are responding to the summation of two or more Gaussian curves, each of which is fixed at a given distance to two or more walls in the environment. The walls themselves are probably identified by their allocentric direction relative to the rat and this information may be provided by the head direction cells. The right human hippocampus retains its role in spatial mapping as demonstrated by its activation during accurate navigation in imagined and virtual reality environments. In addition, it may have taken on wider memory functions, perhaps by the incorporation of a linear time tag which allows for the storage of the times of visits to particular locations. This extended system would serve as the basis for a spatio-temporal event or episodic memory system.","1998-08-29","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 11:24:32",NA,"1333-1340",NA,"1373","353",NA,"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 9770226  PMCID: PMC1692339",NA,"","","Humans; Animals; Rats; Brain Mapping; Movement/*physiology; Neurons/*physiology; Hippocampus/cytology/*physiology; Locomotion/physiology; Spatial Behavior/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two monkeys fixated a 0.2 degrees white square in the center of a video display while depressing a switch located between two touch pads. On each trial, a spatial-attentional/mnemonic (SAM) cue was presented first. The SAM cue consisted of one 2 degrees x 2 degrees square, usually red or green, and its location indicated where a conditional motor instruction would appear after a delay period. The stimulus event containing the  motor instruction, termed the motor instructional/conditional (MIC) cue, could be of two general types. It might consist of a single 2 degrees x 2 degrees square stimulus identical to one of the SAM cues presented at the same location as the SAM cue on that trial. When the MIC cue was a single square, it instructed the monkey to move its forelimb to one of the two touch pads according to the following conditional rule: a green MIC cue meant that contact with the right touch pad would be rewarded on that trial and a red MIC cue instructed a movement to the left touch pad. Alternatively, the MIC cue might consist of two 2 degrees  x 2 degrees squares, only one of which was at the SAM-cue location: in those cases, one square was red and the other was green. The colored square at the SAM  cue location for that trial was the instructing stimulus, and the other part of the MIC cue was irrelevant. When, after a variable delay period, the MIC cue disappeared, the monkey had to touch the appropriate target within 1 s to receive a reward and could break visual fixation. The experimental design allowed comparison of frontal cortical activity when one stimulus, identical in retinocentric, craniocentric, and allocentric spatial location as well as all other stimulus parameters, had two different meanings for the animal's behavior.  When a stimulus was the SAM cue, it led to either a reorientation of spatial attention to its location, or the storage of its location in spatial memory. By contrast, when it was the MIC cue, the same stimulus instructed a motor act to be executed after a delay period. For the majority of PMd neurons (55%), post-MIC cue activity exceeded post-SAM cue activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","1993","2018-06-18 11:24:32","2018-06-18 12:29:03",NA,"15-27",NA,"1","95",NA,"Exp Brain Res",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","eng","","","","",NA,NA,"PMID: 8405247",NA,"","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8405247","Male; Animals; Functional Laterality; Memory/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Attention/*physiology; *Brain Mapping; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Neurons/*physiology; Space Perception/physiology; Frontal Lobe/*physiology; Macaca mulatta/*physiology; Motor Activity/physiology; Motor Cortex/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast, visuoconstructive performance by patients with HD was not significantly impaired, while salient deficits were apparent when manipulation of personal space was required.

It was found that the successful adaptation of patients was based on value orientations characterized by a general compensatory direction at adequately evaluated personal and social difficulties with a high degree of observing social norms. As the adaptation becomes less and  less successful, the part of adequate evaluations and relations determining the patient's self-estimation diminishes, the role of egocentric tendencies and purposes, and primitive requirements gets greater.

Three functional constraints on the hippocampal contribution to memory and imagery are implied by the functional characteristics of place cell firing. First, consistent with the perceptual influence on place cell firing, the hippocampus aids the retrieval or construction of visuospatial scenes by enabling efficient search through the mass of abstract, viewpoint-independent information in the medial temporal lobes by constraining retrieved information to be consistent with perception from one single location. Second, consistent with the path-integrative influence on place cell firing, retrieval or imagery is facilitated by the ability to move the locus of the retrieval location within the retrieved or constructed scene. Third, consistent with remapping of place cell representations in different environments, and closest to the original idea of spatial context, retrieved information from a familiar environment is additionally constrained to be consistent with perception from a location within that specific environment. In this chapter the authors briefly review the three aspects of place cell firing referred to above, and explain how each leads to the corresponding functional constraint. The ramifications of these constraints for the role of the hippocampus in memory and imagery are then discussed. A specific (re)constructive role for the hippocampus in these processes is outlined. With reference to other theories relating the hippocampus specifically to episodic memory, the authors note that, although the proposed construction of rich and dynamic first-person perspective imagery likely also creates a subjective feeling of ""re-experience,"" the same proposed constructive function will also occur in novel imagery and incorrect retrieval. Similarly, the same proposed function could underlie the distinction made between rich contextual recollection and feelings of familiarity.

Place fields of a group of the hippocampal pyramidal cells cover the surface of an environment but do not appear to do so in any systematic fashion. That is, there is no topographical relation between the anatomical location of the cells within the hippocampus and the place fields of these cells in an environment. Recent work shows that place cells are responding to the summation of two or more of Gaussian curves, each of which is fixed at a given distance to two or more walls in the environment. The walls themselves are probably identified by their allocentric direction relative to the rat and this information may be provided by the head direction cells. The right human hippocampus retains its role in spatial mapping as demonstrated by its activation during accurate navigation in imaginary and virtual reality environments. In addition, it may have taken on wider memory functions, perhaps by the incorporation of a linear time tag which allows for the storage of the times or visits to particular locations. This extended system would serve as the basis for a spatio-temporal event or episodic memory system.

The combined computations of a network of systems including place cells in the hippocampus, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and head direction cells found in numerous structures in the brain have been suggested to form the neural instantiation of the cognitive map as first described by Tolman in 1948. However, while our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying spatial representations in adults is relatively sophisticated, we know substantially less about how this network develops in young animals. In this article we briefly review studies examining the developmental timescale that these systems follow. Electrophysiological recordings from very young rats show that directional information is at adult levels at the outset of navigational experience. The systems supporting allocentric memory, however, take longer to mature. This is consistent with behavioral studies of young rats which show that spatial memory based on head direction develops very early but that allocentric spatial memory takes longer to mature. We go on to report new data demonstrating that memory for associations between objects and their spatial locations is slower to develop than memory for objects alone. This is again consistent with previous reports suggesting that adult like spatial representations have a protracted development in rats and also suggests that the systems involved in processing non-spatial stimuli come online earlier.","2012-03","2018-06-18 12:10:25","2018-06-18 12:10:25",NA,"8",NA,"","6",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"PMCID: PMC3290765",NA,"","","hippocampus; place cell; entorhinal cortex; grid cell; head direction cell; memory and learning; postnatal development; spatial representation",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A variety of disorders affecting autobiographical memory are characterized by the difficulty of retrieving specific detailed memories of past personal events. Owing to the impact of autobiographical memory impairment on patients' daily life, it is necessary to better understand these deficits and develop relevant methods to improve autobiographical memory. The primary objective of the present systematic PRISMA review was to give an overview of the first empirical evidence of the potential of wearable cameras in autobiographical memory investigation in remediating autobiographical memory impairments. The peer-reviewed literature published since 2004 on the usefulness of wearable cameras in research protocols was explored in 3 databases (PUBMED, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar). Twenty-eight published studies that used a protocol involving wearable camera, either to explore wearable camera functioning and impact on daily life, or to investigate autobiographical memory processing or remediate autobiographical memory impairment, were included. This review analyzed the potential of wearable cameras for 1) investigating autobiographical memory processes in healthy volunteers without memory impairment and in clinical populations, and 2) remediating autobiographical memory in patients with various kinds of memory disorder. Mechanisms to account for the efficacy of wearable cameras are also discussed. The review concludes by discussing certain limitations inherent to using cameras, and new research perspectives. Finally, ethical issues raised by this new technology are considered.","2017-03","2018-06-18 12:10:27","2018-06-18 12:10:27",NA,"81-99",NA,"","27",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11065-016-9337-x.pdf","Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; *Autobiographical memory; *Memory, Episodic; *Cognitive remediation; *Self-Help Devices; *SenseCam(R); *Video Recording; *Wearable cameras; Memory Disorders/diagnosis/psychology/*rehabilitation",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this article, these different perspectives are brought together, and it is pointed out that integration of diverse functional domains may be a key feature enabling the hippocampus to support not only the encoding and retrieval of certain memory representations, but also their translation into adaptive behavior. The hippocampus appears to combine: (i) sensory afferents and synaptic mechanisms underlying certain types of rapid learning; and (ii) links to motivational, emotional, executive, and sensorimotor functions. Recent experiments are highlighted, indicating that the induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity is required to encode rapidly aspects of experience, such as places, into memory representations; subsequent retrieval of these representations requires transmission through the previously modified hippocampal synapses, but no further plasticity. In contrast, slow incremental place learning may not absolutely require hippocampal contributions. The neocortical sensory inputs, especially visuo-spatial information, necessary for hippocampus-dependent rapid learning, are preferentially associated with the septal to intermediate hippocampus. In contrast, connectivity with the prefrontal cortex and subcortical sites, which link the hippocampus to motivational, emotional, executive, and sensorimotor functions, is primarily associated with the intermediate to temporal hippocampus. A model of functional differentiation and integration along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus is proposed, describing key hippocampal contributions to adaptive behavior based on information encoded during a single or a few past experiences.","2007","2018-06-18 12:10:42","2018-06-18 12:10:42",NA,"253-281",NA,"","18",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","Humans; Animals; Emotions/physiology; Learning/*physiology; Memory/*physiology; Hippocampus/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Cognition/physiology; Neural Pathways/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Adaptation, Psychological/*physiology; Neuronal Plasticity/physiology; Synaptic Transmission/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This link has been supported by clinical reports of long-term episodic memory impairments in psychiatric conditions with dissociative symptoms, in which individuals feel detached from themselves as if having an out-of-body experience. Here, we introduce an experimental approach to examine the necessary role of perceiving the world from the perspective of oneâ€™s own body for the successful episodic encoding of real-life events. While participants were involved in a social interaction, an out-of-body illusion was elicited, in which the sense of bodily self was displaced from the real body to the other end of the testing room. This condition was compared with a well-matched in-body illusion condition, in which the sense of bodily self was colocalized with the real body. In separate recall sessions, performed âˆ¼1 wk later, we assessed the participantsâ€™ episodic memory of these events. The results revealed an episodic recollection deficit for events encoded out-of-body compared with in-body. Functional magnetic resonance imaging indicated that this impairment was specifically associated with activity changes in the posterior hippocampus. Collectively, these findings show that efficient hippocampus-based episodic-memory encoding requires a first-person perspective of the natural spatial relationship between the body and the world. Our observations have important implications for theoretical models of episodic memory, neurocognitive models of self, embodied cognition, and clinical research into memory deficits in psychiatric disorders.

However, until recently, the understanding of these disorders referred mostly to philosophical considerations. The aim of this work is to examine how the various aspects of autobiographical memory deficits may be considered as possible cognitive mechanisms accounting for self-disorders in patients. Methods: We performed a theoretical review of the literature on autobiographical memory studies in schizophrenia. Our approach of cognitive psychopathology was grounded in the model of the Self-Memory System put forward by Conway (2005), which posits reciprocal relationships between autobiographical memory and the self. This model stresses the distinction between the working-self and the autobiographical memory knowledge base. The latter contains all autobiographical information stored in our life and is organized according to the specificity of this information. The role of the working-self is to maintain the coherence of the self and to control the access to autobiographical memories and corresponding memory details. The working-self supports an experiential or phenomenological dimension of the self, especially when a highly detailed autobiographical memory is retrieved, and a past event is re-experienced by the rememberer. The working-self also entails a conceptual part, the conceptual self, which contains self-knowledge and self-images. Results: Our review showed that autobiographical memories of patients with schizophrenia are less specific and contain fewer phenomenological details than those of healthy participants. Patients also have difficulty assessing the subjective temporal distance of past events, and their ability to re-experience unique past personal events is affected as shown by a reduced conscious recollection and a smaller frequency of Field visual perspective during recall of autobiographical memories. This global alteration of all phenomenological characteristics of autobiographical memories strongly suggests an alteration of the phenomenological dimension of the self in schizophrenia. Since some of these alterations are also found in patients when they plan for future personal events, the ability to mentally travel in time is reduced in patients and reflects an impaired sense of self across time. The literature also shows that self-images are more passive, less coherent and less stable in time in patients compared to healthy participants. These results point to an alteration of the conceptual dimension of the self in schizophrenia. This may be partly explained by a weaker connection between the self and autobiographical memory and by other alterations of autobiographical memories closely linked to the self. In fact, the reminiscence bump is disorganized in patients and comprises poorly detailed memories. Memories grounding self-images are less organized and weakly connected to self-images. Finally, patients have an impaired ability to give a meaning to or to draw lessons from self-defining memories of their life. Conclusion: Based on these results, we discuss current and future therapeutic interventions including both cognitive remediation methods and cognitive psychotherapy applied to autobiographical memory. These methods appear relevant to help patients improve both the sense of self associatied with their autobiographical memory retrieval and the coherence and stability of the self.

Performance of these clinical groups was compared with age-matched controls, patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and patients with subjective memory impairments. We investigated the perception (concurrent match-to-sample) and short-term retention (2-s delayed match-to-sample) of the configuration of topographical features in computer-generated landscapes shown from different viewpoints. Thirty-one patients were tested (7 AD, 6 a-MCI, 7 temporal variant FTLD, 5 frontal variant FTLD, 6 subjective memory impairment) and 25 age- and gender-matched controls. Brain MRI was available for 27 patients; medial temporal lobe atrophy was assessed using a visual rating scale. Patients with a-MCI or mild AD were impaired on topographical short-term memory, but not perception. No other group differences were found on the topographical subtests. Notably, patients with temporal variants of FTLD performed normally, regardless of the laterality of damage. Subtests for the perception and retention of nonspatial aspects of the landscapes (weather conditions, seasonal and daily variations in lighting and color) were poor at differentiating the patient groups.

The model proposes that intrusions reflect involuntary reactivation of egocentric representations in the absence of a corresponding allocentric representation. We tested the model by investigating the effect of alcohol on intrusive memories and, concurrently, on egocentric and allocentric spatial memory. METHODS: With a double-blind independent group design participants were administered alcohol (.4 or .8 g/kg) or placebo. A virtual environment was used to present objects and test recognition memory from the same viewpoint as presentation (tapping egocentric memory) or a shifted viewpoint (tapping allocentric memory). Participants were also exposed to a trauma video and required to detail intrusive memories for 7 days, after which explicit memory was assessed. RESULTS: There was a selective impairment of shifted-view recognition after the low dose of alcohol, whereas the high dose induced a global impairment in same-view and shifted-view conditions. Alcohol showed a dose-dependent inverted ""U""-shaped effect on intrusions, with only the low dose increasing the number of intrusions, replicating previous work. When same-view recognition was intact, decrements in shifted-view recognition were associated with increases in intrusions. CONCLUSIONS: The differential effect of alcohol on intrusive memories and on same/shifted-view recognition support a dual representation model in which intrusions might reflect an imbalance between two types of memory representation. These findings highlight important clinical implications, given alcohol's involvement in real-life trauma.","2010-08","2018-06-18 12:11:13","2018-06-18 12:11:13",NA,"280-286",NA,"","68",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0006322310000521/1-s2.0-S0006322310000521-main.pdf?_tid=0036821b-9767-4404-9fb9-7e55dfd914f7&acdnat=1529061212_2bee7c3baa2325935e6c38d319f0c16f","Adult; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Adolescent; Female; Young Adult; Analysis of Variance; Reference Values; Repression, Psychology; Double-Blind Method; Adaptation, Psychological/*drug effects; Central Nervous System Depressants/*pharmacology; Ethanol/*pharmacology; Memory/*drug effects; Recognition (Psychology)/*drug effects; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/physiopathology/*psychology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The explanatory factor analyses performed for each memory type demonstrated the consistency of the AMCQ factor structure across all memory types; while a confirmatory factor analysis on the data garnered from all three studies supported the constructs for the autobiographical memory characteristics defined by the researchers. The AMCQ consists of 63 items and 14 factors, and the internal consistency values of all 14 scales were ranged between .66 and .97. The relationships between the AMCQ scales related to gender and individual emotions, as well as the intercorrelations among the scales, were consistent with both theoretical expectations and previous findings. The results of all the three studies indicated that this new instrument is a reliable and robust measure for memory phenomenology.","2015-10","2018-06-18 12:11:18","2018-06-18 12:11:18",NA,"1070-1092",NA,"","23",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211.2014.953960?needAccess=true","Adult; Humans; Male; Emotions; Validity; Adolescent; Female; Young Adult; Autobiographical memory; Sex Factors; Phenomenology; Life Change Events; Reproducibility of Results; Individuality; Statistics as Topic; Narration; *Memory, Episodic; *Surveys and Questionnaires; Pilot Projects; Psychometrics/*statistics & numerical data; Reliability; Scale development",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recently, research has shown that spatial difficulties in WS extend to large-scale space, particularly in coding space using an allocentric frame of reference. Typically developing (TD) children and adults predominantly rely on the use of a sequential egocentric strategy to navigate a large-scale route (retracing a sequence of left-right body turns). The aim of this study was to examine whether individuals with WS are able to employ a sequential egocentric strategy to guide learning and the retracing of a route. Forty-eight TD children, aged 5, 7, and 9 years and 18 participants with WS were examined on their ability to learn and retrace routes in two (6-turn) virtual environment mazes (with and without landmarks). The ability to successfully retrace a route following the removal of landmarks (use of sequential egocentric coding) was also examined. Although in line with TD 5-year-olds when learning a route with landmarks, individuals with WS showed significantly greater detriment when these landmarks were removed, relative to all TD groups. Moreover, the WS group made significantly more errors than all TD groups when learning a route that never contained landmarks. On a perceptual view-matching task, results revealed a high level of performance across groups, indicative of an ability to use this visual information to potentially aid navigation. These findings suggest that individuals with WS rely on landmarks to a greater extent than TD children, both for learning a route and for retracing a recently learned route. TD children, but not individuals with WS, were able to fall back on the use of a sequential egocentric strategy to navigate when landmarks were not present. Only TD children therefore coded sequential route information simultaneously with landmark information. The results are discussed in relation to known atypical cortical development and perceptual-matching abilities in WS.","2015-02","2018-06-18 12:11:21","2018-06-18 12:11:21",NA,"216",NA,"","6",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"PMCID: PMC4340127",NA,"","","navigation; egocentric; landmarks; visuospatial cognition; Williams syndrome (WS)",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is recent evidence that the caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex are also involved in disambiguation of overlapping spatial representations. The hippocampus and caudate are functionally distinct regions, but both have anatomical links with the orbitofrontal cortex. The present study used an fMRI-based functional connectivity analysis in humans to examine the functional relationship between the hippocampus, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex when participants use contextual information to navigate well-learned spatial routes which share common elements. Participants were trained outside the scanner to navigate virtual mazes from a first-person perspective. Overlapping condition mazes began and ended at distinct locations, but converged in the middle to share some hallways with another maze. Non-overlapping condition mazes did not share any hallways with any other maze. Successful navigation through the overlapping hallways required contextual information identifying the current navigational route to guide the appropriate response for a given trial. Results revealed greater functional connectivity between the hippocampus, caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex for overlapping mazes compared to non-overlapping mazes. The current findings suggest that the hippocampus and caudate interact with prefrontal structures cooperatively for successful contextually dependent navigation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

To investigate the developmental pattern of these two strategies in school-aged children, we used a virtual reality paradigm in which the spontaneous or imposed use of both strategies could be assessed. Our results showed an increase in spontaneous use of the allocentric strategy and also an increase in reliance on environmental landmarks with age. Although a majority of the children spontaneously used the sequential egocentric strategy, all age groups performed above chance when the allocentric strategy was imposed.

A test of episodic-like memory for the rat, the What-Where-Which occasion task (WWWhich), requires the association of object, location, and contextual information to form an integrated memory for an event. The WWWhich task cannot be solved by use of non-episodic information such as object familiarity and is dependent on hippocampal integrity. Thus, it provides an ideal tool with which to test capacity for episodic-like memory in the 3xTg murine model for AD. As this model captures much of the human AD phenotype, we hypothesized that these mice would show a deficit in the WWWhich episodic-like memory task. To test the specificity of any episodic-like deficit, we also examined whether mice could perform components of the WWWhich task that do not require episodic-like memory. These included object (Novel Object Recognition), location (Object Location Task, What-Where task), and contextual (What-Which) memory, as well as another three-component task that can be solved without reliance on episodic recall (What-Where-When; WWWhen). The results demonstrate for the first time that control 129sv/c57bl6 mice could form WWWhich episodic-like memories, whereas, 3xTgAD mice at 6 months of age were impaired. Importantly, while 3xTgAD mice showed some deficit on spatial component tasks, they were unimpaired in the more complex WWWhen combination task (which includes a spatial component and is open to non-episodic solutions). These results strongly suggest that AD pathology centered on the hippocampal formation mediates a specific deficit for WWWhich episodic-like memory in the 3xTgAD model.","2013","2018-06-18 12:12:38","2018-06-18 12:12:38",NA,"681-698",NA,"","33",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://content.iospress.com/download/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad121543?id=journal-of-alzheimers-disease%2Fjad121543","hippocampus; rats; allocentric; context; object recognition; egocentric; 3xtg-ad mice; a-beta; amyloid-beta protein; hippocampal-lesions; perirhinal cortex; postrhinal cortex; scrub jays; transgenic mice; what-where-when",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

People who navigate using this strategy are spatial learners, and this process relies on the hippocampus. Conversely, response learners memorize a series of actions to navigate, which relies on the caudate nucleus. Response learning, which is more efficient, is thought to involve less demanding cognitive operations, and is related to reduced grey matter in the hippocampus. To test if navigational strategy can impact visual attention performance, we investigated if spatial and response learners showed differences in attentional engagement used during a visual spatial task. We tested 40 response learners and 39 spatial learners, as determined by the 4-on-8 Virtual Maze (4/8 VM), on a target detection task designed to elicit an N2pc component (an index visual spatial attention). Spatial learners produced a larger N2pc amplitude during target detection compared to response learners. This relationship might represent an increase in goal-directed attention towards target stimuli or a more global increase in cognitive function that has been previously observed in spatial learners.","2017-05","2018-06-18 12:12:47","2018-06-18 12:12:47",NA,"1387-1395",NA,"","235",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00221-017-4884-9.pdf","Adult; Electroencephalography; Humans; Male; Goals; Female; Photic Stimulation; Young Adult; Brain Mapping; Maze Learning; User-Computer Interface; Evoked Potentials/*physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; Attention/*physiology; Spatial Learning/*physiology; *Attention; *Egocentric/allocentric; *N2pc; *Navigation; *Spatial memory",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the VMPFC might interact with different brain regions during self-referencing in the two groups. In this study, based on data from Ruby et al. (2009), we have explored this issue using psychophysiological interaction analyses. Young and elderly participants had to judge adjectives describing personality traits in reference to the self versus a close friend or relative (the other), taking either a first-person or a third-person perspective. The physiological factor was the VMPFC activity observed in all participants during self-judgement, and the psychological factor was the self versus other referential process. The main effect of first-person perspective in both groups revealed that the VMPFC was co-activated with the left parahippocampal gyrus and the precuneus for self versus other judgments. The main effect of age showed a stronger correlation between activity in the VMPFC and the lingual gyrus in young compared to elderly subjects. Finally, in the interaction, the VMPFC was specifically co-activated with the orbitofrontal gyrus and the precentral gyrus when elderly subjects took a first-person perspective for self-judgements. No significant result was observed for the interaction in young subjects. These findings show that, although the VMPFC is engaged by both young and older adults when making self-referential judgements, this brain structure interacts differently with other brain regions as a function of age and perspective. These differences might reflect a tendency by older people to engage in more emotional/social processing than younger adults when making self-referential judgements with a first-person perspective.","2010-10","2018-06-18 12:12:55","2018-06-18 12:12:55",NA,"341-347",NA,"","53",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1053811910008232/1-s2.0-S1053811910008232-main.pdf?_tid=07972222-b77c-4e0a-83a8-0e7dc6ecfdf2&acdnat=1529061372_d46e3ae50615d38afbd789f542f4c2dc","Adult; Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Female; Brain/*physiology; Judgment/*physiology; *Self-Assessment; Nerve Net/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This supposition is in contrast with current understanding that DMN activated when the subjects are resting and deactivated during any attention-demanding cognitive tasks. To test our proposal, we used, in retrospect, the results from our two early studies (Fingelkurts, 1998; Fingelkurts et al., 2003). In both studies for the majority of experimental trails we indeed found a constellation of operationally synchronized cortical areas (indexed as DMN) that was persistent across all studied experimental conditions in all subjects. Furthermore, we found three major elements comprising this DMN: two symmetrical occipito-parieto-temporal and one frontal spatio-temporal patterns. This new data directly supports the notion that DMN has a specific functional connotation - it provides neurophysiologic basis for self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency.

Applying the electroencephalogram (EEG) operational synchrony analysis to extract three modules of the self-referential brain network in 12 medication-free depressive outpatients and 10 control subjects we have found an increase in the strength of EEG synchrony within all three modules in depressive patients (though non-significant for the right module). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis that used 3 factors (values of synchrony strength for all three modules) as input indicated that combined increase in the strength of synchrony in all three modules was positively associated with severity of depression.

Translational research allowing comparison of similar memory properties between human and rodent models is a requirement for the finding of behavioral and cognitive biomarkers as well as molecular deficits associated to the pathology. In this review, we propose that the ability to remember an ordered sequence of choices during spatial navigation could be one of the episodic memory properties shared by human and rodent models. The ability to learn the correct sequence of choices depends on the hippocampus, requires flexibility and is particularly sensitive to age-related decline in rodents as in humans. In an innovative approach, we took advantage of a well characterized rodent navigation task, the starmaze, to develop a new model of episodic allowing creating and objective experimental testing of a personal past experience without requiring verbal report which can be transferred to human.","2010-12","2018-06-18 12:13:10","2018-06-18 12:13:10",NA,"172-179",NA,"","215",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0166432810004286/1-s2.0-S0166432810004286-main.pdf?_tid=2159b968-3b74-473b-b53c-4944f08ff388&acdnat=1529061398_1fd1fbce23d8904fb968555a4f403974","Humans; Time Factors; Animals; Maze Learning; *Mental Recall; *Models, Psychological; *Models, Animal",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is important provided that positive imagery can be an effective mood repair strategy in healthy individuals. However, (sub-clinical) depressed individuals tend to spontaneously adopt an observer perspective. We investigated whether positive imagery would result in a similar emotional response in dysphoric and non-dysphoric individuals when instructed and trained to use field perspective imagery. Additionally, we compared the emotional response in dysphoric individuals who received instructions to dysphoric individuals who received no instructions on processing mode during positive memory recall. Methods: Dysphoric and non-dysphoric individuals completed a mood induction procedure imagining positive or neutral memories. They received instructions and practice in the use of field perspective imagery. An additional control group of dysphoric individuals recalled positive memories without receiving instructions on processing mode. Results: Dysphoric and non-dysphoric individuals who received instructions on field perspective imagery reported similar use of field and observer perspective imagery, and a similar positive emotional response. Dysphoric individuals who did not receive specific instructions, as compared to those who did, reported greater use of observer perspective and lower levels of positive affect afterwards. Limitations: A dysphoric sample limits generalization to clinically depressed individuals, although these individuals are at risk for developing depression. However, mental imagery used in relapse prevention is likely targeting sub-clinical populations. Conclusions: Providing practice in field perspective imagery could potentially improve the effectiveness of positive memory recall as a mood repair strategy in (sub-clinically) depressed individuals, and may therefore have important therapeutic benefits.

The data have been collected from 130 undergraduate male students (18- 33 ages). Three series of seven different emotional thematic photographs (positive, negative, neutral) were used. Participants were subjected to only one of the three series, either in his own perspective condition or observer perspective condition. During the presentation of thematic photograph series participants' eye movements were recorded. All analysis for memory and eye-tracking measurements were carried out with 3 (Emotional Content: Positive, Negative, Neutral) X 2 (Participants' perspective: Own perspective, observer perspective) between-subjects factorial ANOVA. The results indicated that although central and peripheral details took almost equal attention in both negative and neutral events, only details of the negative event was remembered better. In addition, when compared to negative and neutral events participants looked longer at positive event's central details as well as peripheral details, only details of negative event were remembered better. Consequently, memory enhancement effect occured only in negative emotional event both for central and peripheral details, even though participants paid less or equal attention these details. In addition to effects of emotion, it was seen that like autobiographical memory (Nigro and Neisser, 1983) participants' perspective has also an effect on event memory and attention measured by eye-tracking. According to eye-tracking results looking with his own perspective to the event causes narrowing of attention while looking with observer's perspective to event causes extending of attention. In memory results it was seen that participants in his own perspective condition remembered central details better than participants in the observer condition. In conclusion, it is observed that enhanced memory for negative emotional event can occur independently of attention, so it could be said that attention is not sufficient by itself to remember an event with details, emotional dimension of the event has a decisive role. Additionally, perspective have an effect on attention as well as event memory.","2016","2018-06-18 12:13:51","2018-06-18 12:13:51",NA,"",NA,"","9",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","attention; autobiographical memories; phenomenal characteristics; perspective; emotion; arousing stimuli; event memory; eye-tracking; eyewitness memory; free recall; negativity bias; neutral events; older-adults; self-reference; trade-offs; weapon focus",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We hypothesised that temporally distant self-images would elicit more observer perspectives in episodic thoughts than temporally near self-images and current self-images. Utilising a repeated measures design, sixty-eight undergraduate students completed IAM, I Will Be near and I Will Be far conditions (Rathbone, Conway, & Moulin, 2011) to generate self-images and their related episodic thoughts. It was found that episodic qualities were reliably affected by different self-images. Specifically, observer perspective predilections increased with future temporal distance. Findings are discussed in relation to self-continuity with recommended practical applications of visual perspective utilisation for wellbeing.","2017-07","2018-06-18 12:13:54","2018-06-18 12:13:54",NA,"9-20",NA,"","52",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S105381001630335X/1-s2.0-S105381001630335X-main.pdf?_tid=ca20fdf0-2e03-4487-b39b-7662f4347e5b&acdnat=1529061461_62ffa6c414d4a92d1896a05f354b02cd","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Adolescent; Female; Young Adult; Ego; Imagination/*physiology; Thinking/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, recent findings from monkeys following selective hippocampal lesions have been equivocal. To approximate more closely the situations in which rodents and birds are tested, we used a spatial memory task in which rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) moved about freely in a large room, on a tether. We used MRI-guided stereotaxic surgery to produce selective hippocampal lesions in five monkeys, and retained five unoperated control monkeys. In the study phase of each trial of the matching-to-location task, monkeys found food in one site in an array of identical foraging sites. During the test, which occurred after a delay, monkeys could return to the site where the food had been found during study to obtain more food. In Experiment 1, normal monkeys showed a small significant tendency to return directly to a site where they had previously found food that day. Operated monkeys showed no such matching tendency. In Experiment 2, further training produced reliable matching-to-location performance in both groups at short delays, but monkeys with selective hippocampal lesions rapidly forgot the location of the food. In Experiment 3, we tested whether monkeys used a ""cognitive map"" to encode the location of the hidden food, by requiring them to relocate the food from a starting location different from that used during study. As a group, monkeys were more accurate than expected by chance, indicating that they did encode the rewarded location with respect to allocentric landmarks; however, both groups of monkeys were significantly worse at relocating the food when required to approach from a different location. In Experiment 4, probe trials using symmetrical test arrays found no evidence for egocentric coding of the rewarded location.","2004","2018-06-18 12:13:58","2018-06-18 12:13:58",NA,"808-818",NA,"","14",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.10217","Male; Cues; Female; Animals; Brain Mapping; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Macaca mulatta; Memory/*physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Hippocampus/*injuries; Stereotaxic Techniques",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nonetheless, the hippocampus may be specialized for allocentric topographical processing, which impacts on short-term memory or even perception. To investigate this we developed performance-matched tests of perception (match-to-sample) and short-term memory (2 s delayed-match-to-sample) for the topography and for the nonspatial aspects of visual scenes. Four patients with focal hippocampal damage and one with more extensive damage, including right parahippocampal gyrus, were tested. All five patients showed impaired topographical memory and spared nonspatial processing in both memory and perception. Topographical perception was profoundly impaired in the patient with parahippocampal damage, mildly impaired in two of the hippocampal cases, and clearly preserved in the other two hippocampal cases (including one with dense amnesia). Our results suggest that the hippocampus supports allocentric topographical processing that is indispensable when appropriately tested after even very short delays, while the presence of the sample scene can allow successful topographical perception without it, possibly via a less flexible parahippocampal representation.

Research suggests the perspective adopted in mental imagery modulates its emotional impact. However, little is known about the impact of mental imagery in adolescence, despite adolescence being the key time for the onset of emotional dysfunction. We administered computerised positive versus mixed valence picture-word mental imagery training to male adolescent participants (N = 60, aged 11-16 years) across separate field and observer perspective sessions. Positive mood increased more following positive than mixed imagery; pleasantness ratings of ambiguous pictures increased following positive versus mixed imagery generated from field but not observer perspective; negative interpretation bias on a novel scrambled sentences task was smaller following positive than mixed imagery particularly when imagery was generated from field perspective. These findings suggest positive mental imagery generation alters mood and cognition in male adolescents, with the latter moderated by imagery perspective. Identifying key components of such training, such as imagery perspective, extends understanding of the relationship between mental imagery, mood, and cognition in adolescence.","2017-02","2018-06-18 12:14:11","2018-06-18 12:14:11",NA,"73-88",NA,"","41",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","mental imagery; cognitive bias modification; autobiographical memory; psychopathology; vantage perspective; depressed mood; observer perspective; emotion; adolescence; cognitive training; dsm-iv disorders; field perspective; imagining positive events; national-comorbidity-survey; neuroscience perspective; processing biases; psychiatric-disorders; randomized controlled-trial; scrambled sentences task",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies of lesions in humans, primates and rodents have suggested to some that the primary role of the hippocampus is to act as a temporary memory buffer which is required for the consolidation of long-term memory. The famous case study of patient H.M., in particular, seemed to suggest that the hippocampus was of crucial importance for memory formation. However, recordings of single neurons in freely moving rodents did not support this notion. In such recordings, neurons were found that were active predominately when the animal passed through a particular area in space. Consequently, these neurons were termed 'place cells' and a theory was developed that suggested that the hippocampus acts as a 'cognitive map' that is required for spatial orientation. It was then found that H.M. had significant damage to his temporal lobes that included the amygdala, rhinal cortices, and other areas. Further case studies and selective hippocampal lesions in primates resulted in much milder amnestic symptoms, and lesions of defined cortical areas in the temporal lobes showed that a number of functions previously attributed to the hippocampus were in fact linked to these areas. Further analysis of neuronal activity in the hippocampus showed that not only is spatial information represented there, but also additional information, such as speed of movement, direction of movement, match or non-match detection, olfactorial identification, and others. In addition, it was found that selective lesions of the hippocampus in rodents impaired spatial navigation and memory formation only mildly. Only simultaneous lesions of several cortical areas in conjunction with the hippocamus could reproduce the impairments and symptoms that were previously thought to be observed after hippocampal lesions alone. In conclusion it is proposed that information processing and memory formation is shared by several brain areas that act as a functional system. This review presents evidence from many different studies that the hippocampus is part of this system and plays a supportive role in associating complex multimodal information and laying down new memory traces. In addition, the concept of allocating specific functions (such as the development of a cognitive map) exclusively to the hippocampus is rejected.","2003","2018-06-18 12:14:18","2018-06-18 12:14:18",NA,"253-284",NA,"","14",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","Attention; Humans; Anxiety; Animals; Brain Mapping; Electrophysiology; Motor Activity; Functional Laterality; Space Perception/*physiology; Maze Learning/physiology; Hippocampus/anatomy & histology/*physiology; Memory, Short-Term; Mental Processes/*physiology; Neurons/classification/physiology; Smell/physiology; Time Perception/*physiology; Visual Pathways",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This differential focus on source information during collaborative recall impacted performance on a later source memory test.

The subjects using an allocentric strategy showed stronger activation in the medial temporal areas including the parahippocampal region, the hippocampus, and the thalamus. In addition, the cerebellum was also active in those subjects. We believe that this activation pattern is related to visually guided memory retrieval based on generalized spatial maps.

While the same-view condition could be solved by visual pattern matching, the shifted-view condition requires a viewpoint independent representation or an equivalent mechanism for translating or rotating viewpoints in memory. The latter mechanism was indicated by control subjects' response latencies in the shifted-view condition, although the amnesic case is not impaired in tests of mental rotation of single objects.

Comparing a control with a video gaming training group that was trained for 2 months for at least 30 min per day with a platformer game, we found significant gray matter (GM) increase in right hippocampal formation (HC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral cerebellum in the training group. The HC increase correlated with changes from egocentric to allocentric navigation strategy. GM increases in HC and DLPFC correlated with participants' desire for video gaming, evidence suggesting a predictive role of desire in volume change. Video game training augments GM in brain areas crucial for spatial navigation, strategic planning, working memory and motor performance going along with evidence for behavioral changes of navigation strategy.

However, recent data showing that rats with fornix lesions perform as well as controls in an object-place task, while being impaired on an object-place-context task (Eacott and Norman (2004) J Neurosci 24:1948-1953), suggest that not all forms of context-dependent associative recognition depend on the integrity of the hippocampus. To examine the role of the hippocampus in context-dependent recognition directly, the present study tested the effects of large, selective, bilateral hippocampus lesions in rats on performance of a series of spontaneous recognition memory tasks: object recognition, object-place recognition, object-context recognition and object-place-context recognition. Consistent with the effects of fornix lesions, animals with hippocampus lesions were impaired only on the object-place-context task. These data confirm that not all forms of context-dependent associative recognition are mediated by the hippocampus. Subsequent experiments suggested that the object-place task does not require an allocentric representation of space, which could account for the lack of impairment following hippocampus lesions. Importantly, as the object-place-context task has similar spatial requirements, the selective deficit in object-place-context recognition suggests that this task requires hippocampus-dependent neural processes distinct from those required for allocentric spatial memory, or for object memory, object-place memory or object-context memory. Two possibilities are that object, place, and context information converge only in the hippocampus, or that recognition of integrated object-place-context information requires a hippocampus-dependent mode of retrieval, such as recollection.","2010-10","2018-06-18 12:15:33","2018-06-18 12:15:33",NA,"1139-1153",NA,"","20",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.20714","Male; Animals; Rats; Models, Neurological; Hippocampus/*physiology; Recognition (Psychology)/*physiology; Memory/*physiology; Space Perception/physiology; Association Learning/*physiology; Orientation/physiology; Behavior, Animal/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, little is known about how to ameliorate the negative effects of this ubiquitous social experience. A key preliminary strategy for developing effective methods to reduce the negative impact of ostracism is to examine factors that influence the persistence of these effects. Therefore, the authors examined whether the persistence of these negative effects is dependent on the vantage perspective from which an experience of exclusion is recalled. Using a virtual ball-toss game, being ostracized elicited an immediate aversive effect; furthermore, these effects persisted when individuals recalled the experience from an observer perspective compared with a field perspective. This study shows, for the first time, that the persistence of the debilitating effects of ostracism is influenced by how individuals recall that experience. These results have implications for the development of ameliorative strategies to manage the impact of social exclusion.","2009-06","2018-06-18 12:15:35","2018-06-18 12:15:35",NA,"430-434",NA,"","9",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","memory; anxiety; autobiographical memory; imagery; depression; vantage perspective; intrusive memories; observer perspective; exposure; ostracism; point; recall vantage perspective; social exclusion",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Comparable studies in nonhuman primates, however, are few, and findings are often contradictory. This may be attributable to the failure to distinguish between allocentric and egocentric spatial representations in experimental designs. For this experiment, six adult monkeys received bilateral hippocampal ibotenic acid lesions, and six control subjects underwent sham surgery. Freely moving monkeys then foraged for food located in two arrays of three distinct locations among 18 locations distributed in an open-field arena. Multiple goals and four pseudorandomly chosen entrance points precluded the monkeys' ability to rely on an egocentric strategy to identify food locations. Monkeys were tested in two conditions. First, local visual cues marked the food locations. Second, no local cues marked the food locations, so that monkeys had to rely on an allocentric (spatial relational) representation of the environment to discriminate these locations. Both hippocampal-lesioned and control monkeys discriminated the food locations in the presence of local cues. However, in the absence of local cues, control subjects discriminated the food locations, whereas hippocampal-lesioned monkeys were unable to do so. Interestingly, histological analysis of the brain of one control monkey whose behavior was identical to that of the experimentally lesioned animals revealed a bilateral ischemic lesion restricted to the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that the adult monkey hippocampal formation is critical for the establishment or use of allocentric spatial representations and that selective damage of the hippocampus prevents spatial relational learning in adult nonhuman primates.","2006-04","2018-06-18 12:15:36","2018-06-18 12:15:36",NA,"4546-4558",NA,"","26",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/26/17/4546.full.pdf","Male; Animals; Macaca mulatta; Hippocampus/*physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; *Cues; Psychomotor Performance/*physiology; Association Learning/*physiology; Discrimination Learning/*physiology; Denervation",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To complement these findings, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study found that in healthy participants oddity judgment for novel trial-unique scenes, compared with face or size oddity, was associated with increased posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex activity. In contrast, perirhinal and anterior hippocampus activity was observed during unfamiliar trial-unique face oddity judgment, when contrasted with scene or size oddity tasks. Activity in all of these regions decreased as the stimuli were repeated across trials, reflecting the participants' increasing familiarity with the stimuli. This change was significant in all areas, with the exception of the perirhinal cortex, right anterior hippocampus, and to a lesser extent the left anterior hippocampus during face oddity judgment. One possibility is that the activity in these regions may not reflect entirely episodic memory encoding but, in part, processes beyond the mnemonic domain. Thus, the perirhinal cortex, and possibly anterior hippocampus, may play a more generic role in the discrimination and processing of objects.","2008-03","2018-06-18 12:15:48","2018-06-18 12:15:48",NA,"683-696",NA,"","18",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://watermark.silverchair.com/bhm104.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAb4wggG6BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGrMIIBpwIBADCCAaAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMx54xr3l1qA0doFLmAgEQgIIBcTAjTxYLbAlBrrRxZTROVRUeB-oASGL9ly2EAoTp_pYKSA8j6QYWmvs3C5cj1K1__3wgQ3Pn0IXxFCcU404FwRUykEph6ftiwmOCa8-ZVyfLqrVbkkmSuf8up2hC_bZjCtt3ZBhAz_XNfU0ie1r3b0-fRPyh2TAmVuWlWeQRZ7AsfjvG-K7Q4TfYmP4rnjGOi8eiTa1Zsx3V7A2buctwHA1dEhD33_hwnr-a7IjaWiDSeY-8fTHI93IqG83stv-XpR8oe4GGFBpNIrxe_oZsToDeTG9B6CrXPlKZ9hq12Gv8oW2M9guQCsThjKpml5qJ90t-KrOS1Ewgp69AcIagSwHlG01AYpsb1ZZ12yuB4pJZQfbOkC0LkDyBJBHdhSnMfyimbC1rPeGkH1ll07a4WH9DGsaGI_SkP2gFmvOTZ6_dr_ADhv6PvZPxWLtT83l0WimoAiUW1dPrwzAjqAsY7QRjDzVooL8pb_6QLRxQF48jTA","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Temporal Lobe/*physiology; Memory/physiology; Judgment/*physiology; Reaction Time/physiology; Discrimination Learning/physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/*physiology; *Face; Photic Stimulation/*methods",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using an object-place paired-associate task, we investigated changes in neural firing patterns in the hippocampus in association with a shift in strategy during learning. We used an object-place paired-associate task in which a pair of objects was presented in two different arms of a radial maze. Each object was associated with reward only in one of the arms, thus requiring the rats to consider both object identity and its location in the maze. Hippocampal neurons recorded in CA1 displayed a dynamic transition in their firing patterns during the acquisition of the task across days, and this corresponded to a shift in strategy manifested in behavioral data. Specifically, before the rats learned the task, they chose an object that maintained a particular egocentric relationship with their body (response strategy) irrespective of the object identity. However, as the animal acquired the task, it chose an object according to both its identity and the associated location in the maze (object-in-place strategy). We report that CA1 neurons in the hippocampus changed their prospective firing correlates according to the dominant strategy (i.e., response versus object-in-place strategy) employed at a given stage of learning. The results suggest that neural firing pattern in the hippocampus is heavily influenced by the task demand hypothesized by the animal and the firing pattern changes flexibly as the perceived task demand changes.","2010-08","2018-06-18 12:15:50","2018-06-18 12:15:50",NA,"381-393",NA,"","17",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","episodic memory; primate hippocampus; neurons; cortex; location; caudate-nucleus; complex-spike cells; multiple memory-systems; paired-association; task",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How can the self in autism be both 'absent' (i.e., impaired self-referential cognition), yet 'all too present' (i.e., egocentric)? In this paper, we first review evidence in support of both claims. Second, we highlight new evidence illustrating atypical function of neural systems underlying self-representation in autism. We suggest that egocentrism and impaired self-referential cognition are not independent phenomena. Instead, both egocentrism and impaired self-referential cognition in autism can be resolved as expressions of one common mechanism linked to the atypical function of neural circuitry coding for self-relevant information. We discuss how autism provides a unique window into the neurodevelopmental mechanisms enabling a critical developmental transition in self-awareness. This transition involves a dual understanding that one is similar to, yet distinct from others. The neural and cognitive basis of this developmental transition is central to understanding the development of social cognition as well as the paradox of the autistic self and its relation to social impairment in autism.

Rats were subjected either to a control operation (Sham) or to a fimbria-fornix (FF) transection, which renders the hippocampus dysfunctional and disrupts the acquisition of allocentric place learning. All animals were administered 30 post-lesion acquisition sessions, which spanned either 10 or 30days. The acquisition period was followed by a 7day pause after which a retention probe was administered. The lesioned animals were divided into 3 groups: i) Baseline Acquisition Paradigm (BAP) once daily for 30days starting 1week post-surgery; ii) Early Intensive Acquisition Paradigm (EIAP) 3 times daily for 10days starting 1week post-surgery; and iii) Late Intensive Acquisition Paradigm (LIAP) 3 times daily for 10days starting 3weeks post-surgery. Within the control animals, one group followed the schedule of BAP, and one group followed the schedule of Intensive Acquisition Paradigm (IAP). All lesioned animals showed an impaired task acquisition. LIAP was beneficial in FF animals, in that it led to a better acquisition of the place learning task than the two other acquisition paradigms. The FF/EIAP group did not show improved acquisition compared to the FF/BAP group. The control animals were not differentially affected by the two learning schedules. The findings have implications for cognitive rehabilitation after brain injury and support the assumption that intensive treatment can lead to an improved learning, even when the neural structures underlying such a process are compromised. However, the timing of intensive treatment needs to be considered further.","2012-03","2018-06-18 12:16:30","2018-06-18 12:16:30",NA,"40-51",NA,"","1445",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0006899312000960/1-s2.0-S0006899312000960-main.pdf?_tid=4810aa6b-dbdf-4c1c-b5c9-d61df21e0d58&acdnat=1529061673_fa6323117050454d8fec6000ffcbc870","Male; Analysis of Variance; Time Factors; Animals; Rats; Statistics, Nonparametric; Maze Learning/physiology; Spatial Behavior/*physiology; Retention (Psychology)/physiology; Denervation; Behavior Therapy/*methods; Fornix, Brain/*injuries; Learning Disorders/*etiology/pathology/*rehabilitation; Rats, Wistar; Swimming",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is evidence that the incidences of the two types of perspective differ between at least two different cultural groups. It is hypothesised here that this is a special case of a more general relation between memory perspective and cultural individualism, such that field and observer perspectives are more prevalent among people from, respectively, relatively individualist and relatively collectivist societies. Memory perspectives adopted by participants from a range of different countries were recorded, and were found to vary in the predicted manner. Regression analysis showed that the potential effects of three other cultural variables - uncertainty avoidance, masculinity and, to a lesser extent, power distance - were eclipsed by the influence of individualism, and the implications are discussed.","2012-09","2018-06-18 12:16:47","2018-06-18 12:16:47",NA,"1498-1503",NA,"","21",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1053810012001249/1-s2.0-S1053810012001249-main.pdf?_tid=058f918f-ac08-49e0-9ae3-d3c96ac1fbb6&acdnat=1529062135_d7e55f02aa2dfa83864162cd5f298fbb","Humans; Male; Female; Young Adult; *Memory; *Culture; *Individuality; Masculinity; Power (Psychology); Uncertainty",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

R., Clark, R. E., & Knowlton, B. J. (2001). Retrograde amnesia. Hippocampus 11, 50]. However, large lesions of the hippocampus at different time intervals after acquisition of a watermaze spatial reference memory task have consistently resulted in temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia [Bolhuis, J. J., Stewart, C. A., Forrest, E. M. (1994). Retrograde amnesia and memory reactivation in rats with ibotenate lesions to the hippocampus or subiculum. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 47B, 129; Mumby, D. G., Astur, R. S., Weisend, M. P., Sutherland, R. J. (1999).

P., Mumby, D., Astur, R. S., Hanlon, F. M., et al. (2001). Retrograde amnesia after hippocampal damage: recent vs. remote memories in two tasks. Hippocampus 11, 27]. It is possible that spatial memories acquired during such a task remain permanently dependent on the hippocampus, that chance performance may reflect a failure to access memory traces that are initially unexpressed but still present, or that graded retrograde amnesia for spatial information might only be observed following partial hippocampal lesions. This study examined the retrograde memory impairments of rats that received either partial or complete lesions of the hippocampus either 1-2 days, or 6 weeks after training in a watermaze reference memory task. Memory retention was assessed using a novel 'reminding' procedure consisting of a series of rewarded probe trials, allowing the measurement of both free recall and memory reactivation. Rats with complete hippocampal lesions exhibited stable, temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia, and could not be reminded of the correct location. Partially lesioned rats could be reminded of a recently learned platform location, but no recovery of remote memory was observed. These results offer no support for hippocampus-dependent consolidation of allocentric spatial information, and suggest that the hippocampus can play a long-lasting role in spatial memory. The nature of this role-in the storage, retrieval, or expression of memory-is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Whereas Reed and Squire (Behav Neurosci 1997;111:667-775) found that patients with adult-onset relatively selective hippocampal lesions showed clear item recognition deficits, Vargha-Khadem et al. (Science 1997;277: 376-380, Soc Neurosci Abstr 1998;24:1523) found that 3 patients who suffered selective hippocampal damage in early childhood showed clear recall deficits, but had relatively normal item recognition. Manns and Squire (Hippocampus 1999;9:495-499) argued, however, that item recognition may have been spared in these patients because the early onset of their pathology allowed compensatory mechanisms to develop. Therefore, to determine whether early lesion onset is critical for the relative sparing of item recognition and to determine whether its occurrence is influenced by task factors, we extensively examined item recognition in patient Y.R., who has pathology of adult-onset restricted to the hippocampus. Like the developmental cases, she showed clear free recall deficits on 34 tests, but her item recognition on 43 tests was relatively spared, and markedly less disrupted than her recall. Her item recognition performance relative to that of her controls was not significantly influenced by whether tests tapped visual or verbal materials, had a yes/no or forced-choice format, contained few or many items, had one or several foils per target item, used short or very long delays, or were difficult or easy for normal subjects. Interestingly, YR's bilateral hippocampal destruction was greater than at least 2 of the 3 patients of Manns and Squire (Hippocampus 1999;9:495-499). The possible reasons why item recognition differs across patients with relatively selective hippocampal damage of adult-onset and how the reasons that are truly critical can be best identified are discussed.","2002","2018-06-18 12:16:56","2018-06-18 12:16:56",NA,"325-340",NA,"","12",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.1111","Humans; Middle Aged; Female; Mental Recall; Neuropsychological Tests; *Hippocampus; *Recognition (Psychology); Age of Onset; Brain Diseases/epidemiology/*psychology; Control Groups",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As such, cognitive models predict that social anxiety should be associated with biases in the recall of social events. However, initial experimental studies examining this assumption either failed to find such biases or found only weak evidence for an autobiographical memory bias. The current review examines an emerging line of evidence offering support for the role of an autobiographical memory bias in the development and maintenance of social anxiety. The review begins by examining current theoretical approaches to autobiographical memory before looking at empirical studies that have examined differences between socially anxious and non-anxious individuals in the recall of autobiographical memories. Specific memory biases include properties of social-threat memories, the imagery associated with these memories, and the cognitive processing styles that have been found to either facilitate or inhibit the recall of emotional memories.

Two studies addressed the processing styles during positive memory recall in a non-clinical sample. Participants retrieved a positive memory, which was self-generated (Study 1, n=70) or experimenter-chosen (i.e., academic achievement, Study 2, n=159), followed by the induction of one of three processing styles (between-subjects): in Study 1, a ""concrete/imagery"" vs. ""abstract/verbal"" processing style was compared. In Study 2, a ""concrete/imagery,"" ""abstract/verbal,"" and ""comparative/verbal"" processing style were compared. The processing of a personal memory in a concrete/imagery-based way led to a larger increase in positive affect compared to abstract/verbal processing in Study 1, as well as compared to comparative/verbal thinking in Study 2. Results of Study 2 further suggest that it is making unfavorable verbal comparisons that may hinder affective benefits to positive memories (rather than general abstract/verbal processing per se). The comparative/verbal thinking style failed to lead to improvements in positive affect, and with increasing levels of depressive symptoms it had a more negative impact on change in positive affect. We found no evidence that participant's tendency to have dampening thoughts in response to positive affect in daily life contributed to the affective impact of positive memory recall. The results support the potential for current trainings in boosting positive memories and mental imagery, and underline the search for parameters that determine at times deleterious outcomes of abstract/verbal memory processing in the face of positive information.","2015-03","2018-06-18 12:17:35","2018-06-18 12:17:35",NA,"",NA,"","6",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","memory; recall; mental imagery; episodic memory; visual perspective; major depressive disorder; autobiographical memory retrieval; sad mood; randomized controlled-trial; mental-imagery; abstract/verbal processing; bipolar disorder; happy memories; interpretation bias modification; positive; processing style",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An accumulating body of evidence supports this notion, and preliminary data indicate that modifying self-imagery can potentially reduce fears of negative evaluation in socially anxious individuals. This systematic review aims to evaluate the existing research on the effect of self-imagery on symptoms and processes in social anxiety. METHODS: The following databases were searched: PsycInfo, Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Articles were limited to adult samples and English language papers that examined the effect of self-imagery on at least one measure related to social anxiety. Risk of bias and study results were reviewed for each study. RESULTS: In the 17 studies that were identified, negative self-imagery had a consistently adverse effect on anxiety, self and observer-rated performance appraisals, and negative thoughts for both socially anxious and non-clinical participants. Effects of negative self-imagery were generally not significantly greater for socially anxious participants.

In the rat, cells coding for places, directions, and speed of movement have been recorded from the hippocampus proper and/or the neighbouring subicular complex. Place fields of a group of the hippocampal pyramidal cells cover the surface of an environment but do not appear to do so in any systematic fashion. That is, there is no topographical relation between the anatomical location of the cells within the hippocampus and the place fields of these cells in an environment. Recent work shows that place cells are responding to the summation of two or more Gaussian curves, each of which is fixed at a given distance to two or more walls in the environment. The walls themselves are probably identified by their allocentric direction relative to the rat and this information may be provided by the head direction cells. The right human hippocampus retains its role in spatial mapping as demonstrated by its activation during accurate navigation in imagined and virtual reality environments. In addition, it may have taken on wider memory functions, perhaps by the incorporation of a linear time tag which allows for the storage of the times of visits to particular locations. This extended system would serve as the basis for a spatio-temporal event or episodic memory system.","1998-08-29","2018-06-18 12:17:44","2018-06-18 12:17:44",NA,"1333-1340",NA,"","353",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"PMCID: PMC1692339",NA,"; ; ","http://sussex-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/44SUS_INST/44SUS_SP??url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Amedline&atitle=Place+cells%2C+navigational+accuracy%2C+and+the+human+hippocampus.&title=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&issn=09628436&date=1998-08-29&volume=353&issue=1373&spage=1333&au=O%27Keefe%2C+J%3BBurgess%2C+N%3BDonnett%2C+J+G%3BJeffery%2C+K+J%3BMaguire%2C+E+A&isbn=&jtitle=Philosophical+transactions+of+the+Royal+Society+of+London.+Series+B%2C+Biological+sciences&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/9770226&rft_id=info:doi/; http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/353/1373/1333.full.pdf; https://search.proquest.com/docview/69966526?accountid=14182","Humans; Index Medicus; Hippocampus -- physiology; Spatial Behavior -- physiology; Animals; Rats; Brain Mapping; Hippocampus -- cytology; Movement -- physiology; Neurons -- physiology; Locomotion -- physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Neural activity in the monkey hippocampal formation (HF) was analyzed during a spatial moving task in which the monkey was guided by auditory and visual cues and when stimuli were presented from various directions. The monkey could control a motorized, movable device (cab) and its route to a target location by pressing the proper one of five available bars in an appropriate sequence (spatial moving task). In any of several locations in the field, neural responses were evident in relation to the presentation of various objects or human movement in some relative direction (left, anterior, right) as a directional stimulus test. 2. Of 238 hippocampal neurons analyzed, 172 (72.3%, 238-66) responded in either the spatial moving task, or to the direction from which stimulation was presented, or to the location of the monkey in the field, or to some combination of these. 3. The activity of 79 (33.2%) neurons was higher when the monkey was in some specific location in the field during the spatial moving task, regardless of the approach route or other task parameters (place related neurons). 4. Responses to the task cues in the spatial moving task were evident in 110 (46.3%) neurons (task related neurons). Of these, 77 (32.4%) neurons were not place related. The remaining 33 (13.9%) neurons were both task related and place related. These neurons responded to task cues in only that part of the field in which place related responses occurred. The neural response to the task cues disappeared when the monkey moved out of the place response region. The place related and task related neural responses disappeared when the room light was switched off. Thus information from the environment outside of the cab contributed to the place related and task related responses. 5. Stimuli presented from certain specific directions induced responses, selectively, in 41 (17.2%) of the neurons (direction related neurons). The dependence of the preferred direction was described in one of three ways--egocentric, allocentric, or place-direction specific. Nineteen egocentric neurons responded to a stimulus only when it was presented from a certain direction relative to the orientation of the monkey, regardless of the location of the monkey.

Episodic memory requires the rapid formation and flexible retrieval of where things are located in space. Consciousness of the encoding scene is considered crucial for episodic memory formation. Here, we question the necessity of consciousness and hypothesize that humans can form unconscious episodic memories. Participants were presented with subliminal scenes, that is, scenes invisible to the conscious mind. The scenes displayed objects at certain locations for participants to form unconscious object-in-space memories. Later, the same scenes were presented supraliminally, that is, visibly, for retrieval testing. Scenes were presented absent the objects and rotated by 90 degrees -270 degrees in perspective to assess the representational flexibility of unconsciously formed memories. During the test phase, participants performed a forced-choice task that required them to place an object in one of two highlighted scene locations and their eye movements were recorded. Evaluation of the eye tracking data revealed that participants remembered object locations unconsciously, irrespective of changes in viewing perspective. This effect of gaze was related to correct placements of objects in scenes, and an intuitive decision style was necessary for unconscious memories to influence intentional behavior to a significant degree. We conclude that conscious perception is not mandatory for spatial episodic memory formation.","2018-02","2018-06-18 12:17:54","2018-06-18 12:17:54",NA,"121-135",NA,"","28",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.22815","hippocampus; spatial memory; rats; amnesia; allocentric spatial memory; retrosplenial cortex; working-memory; cytotoxic lesions; cytochrome-oxidase activity; fornix; limbic thalamus; mammillary bodies; zif268",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Successful approaches in each of these domains include trial-spacing, rest, and NMDA or cholinergic receptor modulation, but the goal of enhancement has to be clear as some approaches can enhance in one domain but inhibit in another. Enhancement may also extend the duration of memory rather than augment encoding, an idea conceptually embedded into the synaptic-tagging-and-capture theory of memory persistence.

We assessed whether this generalizes to people with major depression (MD). Additionally, we assessed whether the emotion-reducing effects of adopting a third-person perspective also occur when subjects with MD and HC subjects analyze positive experiences. METHODS: Seventy-two MD subjects and 82 HC subjects analyzed a happy and a negative experience from either a first-person or a third-person perspective. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we found no emotion-reducing effects of third-person perspective in either group thinking about negative events. However, across groups, third-person perspective was associated with less recounting of negative experiences and with a clearer, more coherent understanding of them. Negative affect decreased and positive affect increased in both groups analyzing happy experiences. In MD subjects, decreases in depressive affect were stronger for the third-person perspective. In both groups, positive affect increased and negative affect decreased more strongly for the third-person perspective. LIMITATIONS: While reflecting on their positive memory, MD subjects adopted their assigned perspective for a shorter amount of time (70%) than HC subjects (78%). However, percentage of time participants adopted their assigned perspective was unrelated to the significant effects we found. CONCLUSIONS: Both people suffering from MD and healthy individuals may benefit from processing pleasant experiences, especially when adopting a self-distant perspective.","2017-03","2018-06-18 12:17:58","2018-06-18 12:17:58",NA,"254-262",NA,"","54",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0005791616302269/1-s2.0-S0005791616302269-main.pdf?_tid=f49bae7d-1327-4663-bbb5-e1d0be4aa527&acdnat=1529062056_2ab0420c577a4bc3a1464fa9e6e9fd06","Adult; Depression; Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Memory; Adolescent; Female; Young Adult; Analysis of Variance; Neuropsychological Tests; Vantage point; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Emotions/*physiology; Mental Recall/physiology; Rumination; Anxiety Disorders/complications; Cognition Disorders/*etiology; Depressive Disorder, Major/*complications/*psychology; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/complications; Perspective; Phobic Disorders/complications; Self-distancing",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Converging evidence suggests that hippocampus evaluates the extent to which context-defining features of events occur as expected. The consequence of mismatches, or prediction error, signals from hippocampus is discussed in terms of its impact on neural circuitry that evaluates the significance of prediction errors: Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine cells burst fire to rewards or cues that predict rewards (Schultz, Dayan, & Montague, 1997). Although the lateral dorsal tegmentum (LDTg) importantly controls dopamine cell burst firing (Lodge & Grace, 2006) the behavioral significance of the LDTg control is not known. Therefore, we evaluated LDTg functional activity as rats performed a spatial memory task that generates task-dependent reward codes in VTA (Jo, Lee, & Mizumori, 2013; Puryear, Kim, & Mizumori, 2010) and another VTA afferent, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPTg, Norton, Jo, Clark, Taylor, & Mizumori, 2011). Reversible inactivation of the LDTg significantly impaired choice accuracy. LDTg neurons coded primarily egocentric information in the form of movement velocity, turning behaviors, and behaviors leading up to expected reward locations. A subset of the velocity-tuned LDTg cells also showed high frequency bursts shortly before or after reward encounters, after which they showed tonic elevated firing during consumption of small, but not large, rewards. Cells that fired before reward encounters showed stronger correlations with velocity as rats moved toward, rather than away from, rewarded sites. LDTg neural activity was more strongly regulated by egocentric behaviors than that observed for PPTg or VTA cells that were recorded by Puryear et al. and Norton et al. While PPTg activity was uniquely sensitive to ongoing sensory input, all three regions encoded reward magnitude (although in different ways), reward expectation, and reward encounters. Only VTA encoded reward prediction errors. LDTg may inform VTA about learned goal-directed movement that reflects the current motivational state, and this in turn may guide VTA determination of expected subjective goal values. When combined it is clear the LDTg and PPTg provide only a portion of the information that dopamine cells need to assess the value of prediction errors, a process that is essential to future adaptive decisions and switches of cognitive (i.e. memorial) strategies and behavioral responses.","2015-01","2018-06-18 12:18:21","2018-06-18 12:18:21",NA,"93-108",NA,"","117",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"PMCID: PMC5327698",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1074742714001130/1-s2.0-S1074742714001130-main.pdf?_tid=40d54287-3159-4576-9826-7b8a911e8744&acdnat=1529062025_3aa19f3ecbd70b8964f5528794c3cfd3","Male; Motivation; Animals; Rats; Rats, Long-Evans; Reward; Neurons/*physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Choice Behavior/drug effects/physiology; Decision Making/drug effects/*physiology; Dopamine; GABA-A Receptor Agonists/pharmacology; Lateral dorsal tegmentum; Motor Activity/drug effects; Muscimol/pharmacology; Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus/physiology; Prediction error; Reward processing; Spatial Memory/drug effects/*physiology; Tegmentum Mesencephali/drug effects/*physiology; Velocity; Ventral Tegmental Area/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the way in which perspective has been conceptualized differs across studies. Some studies have suggested perspective is experienced as either a first-person or a third-person perspective, whereas others have suggested both perspectives can be experienced during a single retrieval attempt. This aspect of perspective was examined across three studies, which used different measurement techniques commonly used in studies of perspective. Results suggest that individuals can experience more than one perspective when recalling events. Furthermore, the experience of the two perspectives correlated differentially with ratings of vividness, suggesting that the two perspectives should not be considered in opposition of one another. We also found evidence of a gender effect in the experience of perspective, with females experiencing third-person perspectives more often than males. Future studies should allow for the experience of more than one perspective during retrieval. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This model proposes that view-based egocentric and vestibulomotor translational information are functionally and anatomically separate, and that these parallel systems result in independent, but interacting, models within a neurocognitive map of space. In this context, we selectively review relevant portions of the large literature, addressing the establishment and operation of such spatial constructs in humans and the brain systems that underpin them, with particular reference to the hippocampal formation (HF). We present a reinterpretation of the types of knowledge used in the formation of this spatial construct, the processes that act upon this information, the nature of the final spatial representation, and describe how these universal concepts relate to the proposed model of spatial processing. The relevant experimental paradigms used to examine the neural basis of spatial representation and the main findings from previous research are also briefly presented.

It remains possible, however, that residual hippocampal tissue is functional and contributes to successful performance. Here, we examine brain activity with fMRI during the retrieval of spatial information in K.C. and in healthy controls using landmark and route stimuli from a premorbidly familiar neighborhood that K.C. can navigate normally. In all participants, activity was found in the parahippocampal cortex, but not in the hippocampus itself, during all navigational tasks on which K.C. performs well, even though part of his hippocampus remains viable. The opposite pattern was observed on a house recognition task, which is inconsequential to navigation, and on which K.C. performed poorly. On that task, K.C. recruited the right hippocampus presumably because even ""familiar"" houses were treated as novel by him, whereas controls recruited occipitotemporal cortex, including parahippocampal cortex. The distinction between recent and remote memory, therefore, may apply as much to spatial theories of hippocampal function as it does to theories emphasizing the role of the hippocampus in other types of explicit memory.","2007","2018-06-18 12:19:13","2018-06-18 12:19:13",NA,"1241-1251",NA,"","17",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hipo.20354","Adult; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Female; Brain Mapping; Neuropsychological Tests; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Recognition (Psychology)/*physiology; Oxygen/blood; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; *Environment; Anomia/*pathology/*physiopathology; Hippocampus/*blood supply/*pathology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Remembering past behaviors from a first-person actor perspective implies that the behaviors are true of the self and impacts self-definition to a relatively greater degree.

It is less clear how a break in the continuous interaction between these two representations may be a crucial marker to detect patients who are at risk to develop dementia. The main objective of this study is to compare the performances of participants suffering from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI group), patients with AD (AD group) and a control group (CG), using a virtual reality (VR)-based procedure for assessing the abilities in encoding, storing and syncing different spatial representations. In the first task, participants were required to indicate on a real map the position of the object they had memorized, while in the second task they were invited to retrieve its position from an empty version of the same virtual room, starting from a different position. The entire procedure was repeated across three different trials, depending on the object location in the encoding phase. Our finding showed that aMCI patients performed significantly more poorly in the third trial of the first task, showing a deficit in the ability to encode and store an allocentric viewpoint independent representation. On the other hand, AD patients performed significantly more poorly when compared to the CG in the second task, indicating a specific impairment in storing an allocentric viewpoint independent representation and then syncing it with the allocentric viewpoint dependent representation. Furthermore, data suggested that these impairments are not a product of generalized cognitive decline or of general decay in spatial abilities, but instead may reflect a selective deficit in the spatial organization Overall, these findings provide an initial insight into the cognitive underpinnings of amnestic impairment in aMCI and AD patient exploiting the potentiality of VR.","2015-05","2018-06-18 12:19:39","2018-06-18 12:19:39",NA,"88",NA,"","7",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"PMCID: PMC4438252",NA,"","","Alzheimer's disease; mild cognitive impairment; virtual reality; allocentric representation; egocentric representation",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, there exists from the earliest stages of AD a specific impairment in ""mental frame syncing,"" which is the ability to synchronize an allocentric viewpoint-independent representation (including object-to-object information) with an egocentric one by computing the bearing of each relevant ""object"" in the environment in relation to the stored heading in space (i.e., information about our viewpoint contained in the allocentric viewpoint-dependent representation). The main objective of this development-of-concept trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a novel VR-based training protocol focused on the enhancement of the ""mental frame syncing"" of the different spatial representations in subjects with AD. We recruited 20 individuals with AD who were randomly assigned to either ""VR-based training"" or ""Control Group."" Moreover, eight cognitively healthy elderly individuals were recruited to participate in the VR-based training in order to have a different comparison group. Based on a neuropsychological assessment, our results indicated a significant improvement in long-term spatial memory after the VR-based training for patients with AD; this means that transference of improvements from the VR-based training to more general aspects of spatial cognition was observed. Interestingly, there was also a significant effect of VR-based training on executive functioning for cognitively healthy elderly individuals. In sum, VR could be considered as an advanced embodied tool suitable for treating spatial recall impairments.","2017-07","2018-06-18 12:19:41","2018-06-18 12:19:41",NA,"",NA,"","9",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","","prefrontal cortex; episodic memory; hippocampus; spatial memory; allocentric; virtual reality; egocentric; alzheimer's disease; environments; human spatial navigation; parahippocampal; place recognition; population; rehabilitation; reorientation",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, recent evidence has pointed to the recruitment of areas outside the hippocampus proper on spatial memory tasks, including the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus, possibly suggesting a more focused role for the hippocampus proper. In this study, a virtual version of the standard rodent spatial memory assessment, the Morris water task, has been employed during fMRI to investigate the differential involvement of these distinct brain areas. Twenty-eight healthy participants completed a block designed version of the virtual Morris water task (vMWT) which consisted of three conditions: (1) a hippocampal dependent condition during which the participants were forced to use distal room cues in the virtual environment to navigate to a hidden platform; (2) a non-hippocampal dependent condition during which participants were to navigate to a visible platform; (3) a fixation period. Activations of the BOLD signal were evident in the hidden condition as compared to the visible condition in the parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, and fusiform when analyzed using to a blocked analysis. Moreover, this blocked analysis revealed increases in the right hippocampal BOLD signal during fixation. However, when hidden trials were compared to visible trials using a post hoc event-related analysis focused on the beginning of each trial, activations of the right hippocampus are evident. These results support the theory that extra-hippocampal structures contribute to spatial memory behavior and identify a temporally specific involvement of the hippocampus. Furthermore, they substantiate previous results reporting hippocampal BOLD increases during fixation.","2008-03","2018-06-18 12:19:54","2018-06-18 12:19:54",NA,"433-441",NA,"","187",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0166432807005268/1-s2.0-S0166432807005268-main.pdf?_tid=8e1889ba-7e80-48f8-b782-bcc9f7602654&acdnat=1529061905_7be0edab47ed48add7d2aeb075df9247","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mental Recall/*physiology; Oxygen/blood; Space Perception/*physiology; Evoked Potentials/physiology; *Brain Mapping; Functional Laterality/physiology; Spatial Behavior/*physiology; Maze Learning/*physiology; Discrimination Learning/physiology; Hippocampus/blood supply/*metabolism",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

One idea is that the hippocampus is specifically important for allocentric spatial memory, e.g., the hippocampus is especially needed to remember object locations when there is a shift in viewpoint between study and test. We tested this proposal in two experiments. Patients with damage limited to the hippocampus were given memory tests for object locations in a virtual environment. In the first experiment, participants studied locations of a variable number of images (one to five) and tried to remember the image locations from either the same viewpoint as during study (shift of 0 degrees) or a different viewpoint (shift of 55 degrees, 85 degrees, or 140 degrees). In each viewpoint condition (shifts of 0 degrees, 55 degrees, 85 degrees, and 140 degrees), patients performed normally when remembering one or two image locations. Further, performance declined to a similar degree in each viewpoint condition as patients tried to remember increasing numbers of image locations. In the second experiment, participants tried to remember four images after viewpoint shifts of 0 degrees, 55 degrees, 85 degrees, or 140 degrees. Patients were mildly impaired at all conditions (shifts of 0 degrees, 55 degrees, 85 degrees, and 140 degrees), and the impairment was no greater when viewpoint shifted. We conclude that damage to the hippocampus does not selectively impair viewpoint-independent spatial memory. Rather, hippocampal damage impairs memory as the memory load increases.","2007-02","2018-06-18 12:19:57","2018-06-18 12:19:57",NA,"2961-2966",NA,"","104",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"PMCID: PMC1815289",NA,"","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1815289/pdf/zpq2961.pdf","Adult; Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Female; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Memory Disorders; Hippocampus/*physiology; Memory/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Trauma-exposed individuals with (N=29) and without (N=30) a diagnosis of PTSD completed two tests of spatial processing: a topographical recognition task comprising perceptual and memory components, and a test of memory for objects' locations within a virtual environment in which the test is from either the same viewpoint as presentation (solvable with egocentric memory) or a different viewpoint (requiring allocentric memory). Participants in the PTSD group performed significantly worse on allocentric spatial processing than trauma-exposed controls. Groups performed comparably on egocentric memory and non-spatial memory for lists of objects. Exposure to repeated incident trauma was also associated with significantly worse spatial processing in the PTSD group. Results show a selective impairment in allocentric spatial processing, implicating weak hippocampal functioning, as predicted by a neurobiological dual representation model of PTSD.

It argues that Richard Wollheim's related distinction between centred and acentred memory fails to capture the key phenomena, and criticizes Wollheim's reasons for doubting that observer 'memories' are genuine personal memories. Since field perspectives in personal memory are also likely to be the product of constructive processes, we should reject the common assumption that such constructive processes inevitably bring distortion and error. Yet field perspectives tend to be treated as privileged also in the domains of memory for skilled movement, and memory for trauma.

METHOD: A cohort of 22 patients with dementia (11 bvFTD; 11 AD) and 14 healthy controls were assessed on the virtual supermarket task of spatial orientation and a battery of standardized neuropsychological measures of visual and verbal memory performance. RESULTS: Judgements of egocentric and allocentric heading direction were differentially impaired in bvFTD and AD, with AD performing significantly worse on egocentric heading judgements than bvFTD. Both patient cohorts, however, showed similar degree of impaired allocentric spatial representation, and associated hippocampal pathology.

By contrast, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes show generally intact spatial orientation at presentation. However, currently no clinical tasks are routinely administered to objectively assess spatial orientation in these neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we investigated spatial orientation in 58 dementia patients and 23 healthy controls using a novel virtual supermarket task as well as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We compared performance on this task with visual and verbal memory function, which has traditionally been used to discriminate between AD and FTD. Participants viewed a series of videos from a first person perspective travelling through a virtual supermarket and were required to maintain orientation to a starting location. Analyses revealed significantly impaired spatial orientation in AD, compared to FTD patient groups. Spatial orientation performance was found to discriminate AD and FTD patient groups to a very high degree at presentation. More importantly, integrity of the RSC was identified as a key neural correlate of orientation performance. These findings confirm the notion that i) it is feasible to assess spatial orientation objectively via our novel Supermarket task; ii) impaired orientation is a prominent feature that can be applied clinically to discriminate between AD and FTD and iii) the RSC emerges as a critical biomarker to assess spatial orientation deficits in these neurodegenerative conditions.","2015-06","2018-06-18 12:20:59","2018-06-18 12:20:59",NA,"83-94",NA,"","67",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0010945215001070/1-s2.0-S0010945215001070-main.pdf?_tid=55a81c88-56f6-4b15-b9eb-78def0dc1ce8&acdnat=1529061843_577ccba035be9bca9083997559143aba","Humans; Male; Aged; Middle Aged; Female; User-Computer Interface; Orientation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Case-Control Studies; Alzheimer's disease; *Space Perception; Alzheimer Disease/pathology/*physiopathology; Cerebral Cortex/pathology/physiopathology; Confusion/pathology/*physiopathology; Frontotemporal dementia; Frontotemporal Dementia/pathology/*physiopathology; Parietal Lobe/pathology/*physiopathology; Retrosplenial cortex; Temporal Lobe/pathology/*physiopathology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this group, the third-person visualization induced stronger intentions to engage in the behavior when the imagined behavior was public (Study 1), whereas the first-person visualization induced stronger intentions and greater likelihood to engage in that behavior when it was private (Study 2). The influence of the first-person perspective on flossing behavior was eliminated when people with high levels of face were encouraged to consider inter-personal consequences of the action (Study 3). Results are discussed in the light of recent theorizing on the cognitive consequences of taking a third-person versus a first-person perspective in visual imagery. (C) 2014 The Authors.

While most accounts of diencephalic amnesia emphasize the functional importance of the hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies, the present study tested the importance of the other major input to the mammillary bodies, the projections from the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTNg). Although the VTNg, and its projections to the mammillary bodies, is present across species, the size and location of this structure has made it an extremely difficult structure to assess in primates. The effects of selective, neurotoxic lesions of the VTNg were, therefore, assessed in rats. The animals with these lesions were impaired on a series of spatial learning tasks, namely delayed-matching-to-place in the water maze, T-maze alternation and working memory in the radial arm maze. Normal performance on these tasks is dependent on those brain structures (e.g. hippocampus and mammillary bodies) that are now assumed to cause anterograde amnesia when damaged in humans. In contrast, the same rats with ventral tegmental nucleus lesions performed normally on two control tasks: the acquisition and subsequent reversal of an egocentric discrimination task and a visually cued task in the water maze. This study provides the first clear evidence that the VTNg is critical for memory, and consequently indicates that diencephalichippocampal models of memory should be extended to incorporate the limbic midbrain.","2009-09","2018-06-18 12:21:13","2018-06-18 12:21:13",NA,"2372-2384",NA,"","132",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://watermark.silverchair.com/awp175.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAb4wggG6BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGrMIIBpwIBADCCAaAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMQopfsAMTxhZmqvBIAgEQgIIBcXmuTsLW-c9elkkEQLrxzG7-rHizdHSAop5JTBSea0UmjuDjUl29f1k91GvrTRTX1XXuAdB7qawBfoAyz3Dj-SGuzt6t9SPIKwXgiXZ99ctbMWNUpF1pmemOFKw1UU-qtAoR9E4CAHRB9-zw454Fs5jYNDUPrQ5EvyA1VIYHTkNiRQywUVccz2MDqEQ-CoHCwBYpTaXVlMpMEaxa6XuKe0YGVHEkSSrBDeFrPHcg1KizVxnopfemtYvN66QEVErDLIVlQYKCxal_Lxi5UXFqwQQa9gM96IV3QISRtZHtlLDZi5KQtrKXjGVSlDkvlWgGT538QxTJ0A5oKWtrh4yx5FYg0WIBKfQzrVp8nBBF5fHJxGnZNKxXv5pYr9OQbqCYl8zVHm1VbJAbHC0SjfjYmHJx9vNwOmFZ0hg1vb5vbnzrNWtATkL4T-xCjmMLKR7AG4g7mN8KNp6Z4s7a3PHZBoySsavOyD_CUdaJS_v1mbBOzw","episodic memory; amnesia; recognition memory; mammillary bodies; afferent connections; alzheimers-disease; anterior thalamus; dorsal tegmental nucleus; hippocampal theta-rhythm; horseradish-peroxidase; mamillary body; mammillary body; rat; supramammillary nucleus",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, however, the impact of vantage perspective on the emotions elicited by positive memories and images of positive future events has been minimally explored. We experimentally manipulated the vantage perspective from which a sample of undergraduate students (n =80) recalled positive memories and imagined positive future events. Participants who naturally recalled their positive memories from a field perspective reported decreased vividness and positive affect (i.e., happiness, optimism, hopefulness) when they were instructed to shift to an observer perspective. The same pattern of emotionality ratings was observed when participants' vantage perspective of imagined future events was manipulated. In contrast, shifting participants from observer to field perspective recall of positive memories did not result in changes in ratings of memory-related emotion, although we found an unexpected trend towards reduced vividness. For positive future events, shifting from an observer to a field perspective resulted in decreased vividness but did not lead to any changes in positive emotion. Our findings confirm that vantage perspective plays a key role in determining the emotional impact of positive memories, and demonstrate that this relationship is also evident for images of future positive events.","2014-04","2018-06-18 12:21:20","2018-06-18 12:21:20",NA,"256-264",NA,"","22",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09658211.2013.778292?needAccess=true","memory; autobiographical memory; imagery; dysphoria; depression; vantage perspective; intrusive memories; future; point; specificity; episodic simulation",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The majority of narratives trended toward the first-person perspective, with memories more likely to yield first-person perspective than future events. Perspective was predicted by detail (higher level of participant-reported visual detail was more likely to elicit first-person perspective), and temporal distance (events reported as being further away in time were more likely to elicit third-person perspective). Detail, in turn, was explained (among others) by the individual-differences variable of depression/social uncertainty (a factor-derived scale consisting of rumination scales, the inverse of the Sense Of Self Scale, the Social Phobia Scale, and, to a lesser extent, the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale). Generally, predictors for memories and future events overlapped.

A commonly employed animal model of diencephalic amnesia, pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD), results in brain lesions and impairments similar in nature and distribution to those observed in humans with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). In the current investigation, 2 separate experiments were conducted in which acetylcholine (ACh) efflux was assessed in the hippocampus and striatum of PTD-treated and pair-fed (PF) control male Sprague-Dawley rats. The goal was to determine under what behavioral conditions and in which brain structures ACh efflux was spared, impaired, or adaptively enhanced. In Experiment 1, rats were assessed on a spontaneous alternation task; in Experiment 2, rats were tested on a T-maze discrimination task that could be learned via a hippocampal- or striatal-based strategy. In Experiment 1, PTD-treated rats were impaired on the spontaneous alternation task and ACh efflux in the hippocampus during testing was significantly reduced, but spared in the striatum. In Experiment 2, PTD- and PF-treated rats did not differ in the number of trials to criterion, but PTD-treated rats demonstrated greater reliance upon egocentric cues to solve the task. Furthermore, ACh efflux in the striatum was greater during maze learning in the PTD-treated animals when compared to the PF animals. These results suggest that there is behavioral and systems level plasticity that can facilitate the use of alternative strategies to solve a task following diencephalic damage and WKS.

At the underlying representational or cognitive level, these operations are processed in an egocentric reference frame, where locations are represented centered around another person's (3PP) or one's own perspective (1PP). To study 3PP and 1PP, both operating in egocentric frames, a virtual scene with an avatar and red balls in a room was presented from different camera viewpoints to normal volunteers (n = 11) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. The task for the subjects was to count the objects as seen either from the avatar's perspective (3PP) or one's own perspective (1PP). The scene was presented either from a ground view (GV) or an aerial view (AV) to investigate the effect of view on perspective taking. The factors perspective (3PP vs. 1PP) and view (GV vs. AV) were arranged in a two-five two-factorial way. Reaction times were increased and percent factorial correctness scores were decreased in 3PP as opposed to 1PP. To detect the neural mechanisms associated with perspective taking, functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed. Data were analyzed using SPM'99 in each subject and non-parametric statistics on the group level. Activations common to 3PP and 1PP (relative to baseline) were observed in a network of occipital, parietal, and prefrontal areas. Deactivations common to 3PP and 1PP (relative to baseline) were observed predominantly in mesial (i.e., parasagittal) cortical and lateral superior temporal areas bilaterally. Differential increases of neural activity were found in mesial superior parietal and right premotor cortex during 3PP (relative to 1PP), whereas differential increases during 1PP (relative to 3PP) were found in mesial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal cortex bilaterally. The data suggest that in addition to joint neural mechanisms, for example, due to visuospatial processing and decision making, 3PP and 1PP rely on differential neural processes. Mesial cortical areas are involved in decisional processes when the spatial task is solved from one's own viewpoint, whereas egocentric operations from another person's perspective differentially draw upon cortical areas known to be involved in spatial cognition.","2004-06","2018-06-18 12:21:26","2018-06-18 12:21:26",NA,"817-827",NA,"","16",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089892904970799?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed","prefrontal cortex; parietal cortex; autobiographical memory; imagery; functional magnetic-resonance; default mode; right-hemisphere; brain-damaged patients; language; space",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Virtual reality environments have a major advantage for the assessment of spatial navigation and memory formation, as computer-simulated first-person environments can simulate navigation in a large-scale space. However, virtual reality studies on allocentric memory in subjects with cortical lesions are rare, and studies on egocentric memory are lacking. Twenty-four subjects with unilateral parietal cortex lesions due to infarction or intracerebral haemorrhage (14 left-sided, 10 right-sided) were compared with 36 healthy matched control subjects on two virtual reality tasks affording to learn a virtual park (allocentric memory) and a virtual maze (egocentric memory). Subjects further received a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological investigation, and MRI lesion assessment using T(1), T(2) and FLAIR sequences as well as 3D MRI volumetry at the time of the assessment. Results indicate that left- and right-sided lesioned subjects did not differ on task performance. Compared with control subjects, subjects with parietal cortex lesions were strongly impaired learning the virtual maze. On the other hand, performance of subjects with parietal cortex lesions on the virtual park was entirely normal. Volumes of the right-sided precuneus of lesioned subjects were significantly related to performance on the virtual maze, indicating better performance of subjects with larger volumes. It is concluded that parietal cortices support egocentric navigation and imagination during spatial learning in large-scale environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the putative role of the PHC in egocentric (body-centered) spatial learning has received only limited systematic investigation. METHODS: To examine the role of the PHC in egocentric learning, 19 healthy volunteers learned to find their way in a virtual maze during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The virtual maze presented a first-person view, lacked any topographical landmarks and could be learned only using egocentric navigation strategies. RESULTS: During learning, increased medial temporal lobe activity was observed in the PHC bilaterally. Activity was also observed in cortical areas known to project to the PHC and proposed to contribute to egocentric spatial navigation and memory. CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to a role of the PHC for the representation and storage of egocentric information. It seems possible that the PHC contributes to egocentric memory by its feedback projections to the posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, access to allocentric and egocentric streams of spatial information may enable the PHC to construct a global and comprehensive representation of spatial environments and to promote the construction of stable cognitive maps by translating between egocentric and allocentric frames of memory.","2010-01","2018-06-18 12:21:51","2018-06-18 12:21:51",NA,"46-55",NA,"","93",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1074742709001518/1-s2.0-S1074742709001518-main.pdf?_tid=d2b21b66-edb5-4ca2-9122-82be83ff15b3&acdnat=1529061773_8adae4c22716eea365a391cfa120b599","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Brain Mapping; User-Computer Interface; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Learning/*physiology; Memory/physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; Parahippocampal Gyrus/*physiology; Maze Learning/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These strategies are associated with dissociable brain systems. Here, we use brain-imaging and cognitive tasks to test the hypothesis that individuals living with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD) have selective impairment using a hippocampal-dependent spatial navigation strategy. Brain activation and memory performance were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the 4-on-8 virtual maze (4/8VM) task, a human analog of the rodent radial-arm maze that is amenable to both response-based (egocentric or landmark-based) and spatial (allocentric, cognitive mapping) strategies to remember and navigate to target objects. SSD (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder) participants who adopted a spatial strategy performed more poorly on the 4/8VM task and had less hippocampal activation than healthy comparison participants using either strategy as well as SSD participants using a response strategy. This study highlights the importance of strategy use in relation to spatial cognitive functioning in SSD. Consistent with a selective-hippocampal dependent deficit in SSD, these results support the further development of protocols to train impaired hippocampal-dependent abilities or harness non-hippocampal dependent intact abilities.","2017-10","2018-06-18 12:21:56","2018-06-18 12:21:56",NA,"1-8",NA,"","268",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","English","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0925492717301063/1-s2.0-S0925492717301063-main.pdf?_tid=2d871124-2dc2-418e-9ed2-0da6ed3a64fc&acdnat=1529061777_b0971c3078418033ce03336a8986a9f3","episodic memory; hippocampus; spatial memory; spatial navigation; fmri; human brain; metaanalysis; deficits; hypothesis; impairment; magnetic resonance imaging, functional; morris water task; navigation task; schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; spatial-memory; user-computer interface",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The VR-O rats exhibited significant savings in finding the locations of specific reward compartments within the village, relative to a group of old rats (VNR-O) experiencing the village for the first time. The VNR-O rats were also impaired, relative to naive young rats, in learning the reward locations. Probe tests indicated that the VR-O rats retained allocentric spatial memory for the environment and were not using sensory or other non-spatial cues to guide behaviour. Overall, the results indicate that the aged rats experienced a decline in the ability to learn and remember detailed spatial relationships and that the VR-O group's successful performance on the remote spatial memory test was guided by a form of schematic memory that captured the essential features of the village environment.

Behavioral evidence suggests that these perceptual experiences can be used not only to acquire route knowledge but also to directly assemble map-like survey representations. Most studies of human navigation focus on the retrieval of previously learned environments, and the neural foundations of integrating sequential views into a coherent representation are not yet fully understood. We therefore used our recently introduced virtual-reality paradigm, which provides accuracy and reaction-time measurements precisely indicating the emergence of survey knowledge, and functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants repeatedly encoded a complex environment from a first-person ground-level perspective. Before the experiment, we gave specific instructions to induce survey learning, which, based on the clear evidence for emerging survey knowledge in the behavioral data from 11 participants, proved successful. Neuroimaging data revealed increasing activation across sessions only in bilateral retrosplenial cortices, thus paralleling behavioral measures of map expertise. In contrast, hippocampal activation did not follow absolute performance but rather reflected the amount of knowledge acquired in a given session. In other words, hippocampal activation was most prominent during the initial learning phase and decayed after performance had approached ceiling level. We therefore conclude that, during navigational learning, retrosplenial areas mainly serve to integrate egocentric spatial information with cues about self-motion, whereas the hippocampus is needed to incorporate new information into an emerging memory representation.","2005-03","2018-06-18 12:22:06","2018-06-18 12:22:06",NA,"3333-3340",NA,"","25",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/25/13/3333.full.pdf","Adult; Humans; Male; User-Computer Interface; Hippocampus/*physiology; Learning/*physiology; Oxygen/blood; Space Perception/*physiology; *Brain Mapping; Spatial Behavior/*physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Reaction Time/physiology; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Gyrus Cinguli/*physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examined whether postoperative enrichment promotes the recovery of the flexible use of spatial representations in rats with AT lesions. After training to swim from a single constant start position to a submerged platform in a Morris water maze, rats with AT lesions that were housed in standard cages (AT-Std) performed poorly when required to swim to the platform from novel start positions during probe trials. By contrast, rats with AT lesions but housed in enriched environments (AT-Enr), like sham-lesion rats, showed relatively little disruption when tested with novel start positions. AT-Std rats also initially showed impaired acquisition of the task, whereas AT-Enr rats learned at a similar rate to that of the Sham-Std group. Beneficial effects of enrichment were replicated in the subsequent standard water maze procedure that used varying start positions throughout training to acquire a new platform location. Although it is clear that AT damage can severely disrupt episodic-like memory processes, and appear to be a core part of the interlinked neural systems subserving episodic memory, the current findings strongly encourage study on the adaptive response of the brain to thalamic lesions and prospects for the development of rehabilitation programs in cases of anterograde amnesia associated with diencephalic injury.

In brief, it is thought that the posterior hippocampus represents environmental detail and/or encodes space, whereas the anterior part represents the environment more as a whole and/or subserves behavior. Different phases of navigation should thus recruit different structures within the MTL. Based on animal studies and neuroimaging data from humans, the initial phase of navigation, i.e., self-localization, target localization and path planning, should depend on the anterior MTL independent of upcoming navigational demands, whereas posterior MTL should be active throughout navigation. We tested this prediction using fMRI with navigation in a learned large-scale virtual office landscape with numerous complex landmarks under different navigational conditions. The initial navigational phase specifically engaged the anterior MTL. Increased activity was found bilaterally in the rostral and caudal entorhinal cortex. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of entorhinal activity in virtual navigation detected in a direct comparison. Also bilateral anterior hippocampus and anterior parahippocampal cortex were significantly more active during the initial phase. Activity lasting throughout the navigational period was found in the right posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. Hippocampal activity for the entire navigation period was only detected when the virtual environment remained unaltered. Navigational success was positively correlated with activity in the anterior right hippocampus for the initial phase, and more posteriorly in the hippocampus for the whole navigation period. Plots of the BOLD signal time course demonstrated that activity in the anterior hippocampus was transient whereas activity in the posterior hippocampus peaked regularly throughout the entire navigation period. These results support a functional segregation within the MTL with regard to navigational phases. The anterior MTL appears to complete associations related to the environment at large and provide a behavioral plan for navigation, whereas the posterior part keeps track of current location.","2010-10","2018-06-18 12:22:15","2018-06-18 12:22:15",NA,"1654-1666",NA,"","52",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1053811910008268/1-s2.0-S1053811910008268-main.pdf?_tid=89f94f3e-6dbd-413e-8e2a-7849c65391c5&acdnat=1529061738_28f18d47b0db2936b750e955e5c6a6f3","Adult; Humans; Male; Female; Evoked Potentials/*physiology; Temporal Lobe/*physiology; Space Perception/*physiology; Orientation/*physiology; *Magnetic Resonance Imaging",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While recent research has investigated a number of strategies to counter rumination and its negative effects, few have investigated their efficacy outside of a clinical or laboratory context. The current study used a daily diary methodology to compare the efficacy of three such strategies in the everyday lives of a highly ruminative sample. Over the course of 10 days, participants (N = 154) were asked to apply one of three perspectives (distanced, immersed, or distraction) to their thoughts and emotions about the most stressful event of the day and then to write a short narrative about the event. Over the 10-day period, immersion was associated with an average increase in negative emotion from before to after the narrative, whereas distancing was associated with little reactivity, and distraction was associated with a decrease in negative emotion. Participants in the distanced condition showed less ruminative, unproductive processing and used fewer negative emotion words in the narratives than those in the immersed condition. These differences were maintained over the 10-day study period. In targeted analyses of the days with the highest level of ruminative processing and/or event-related stress for each individual, the distanced and immersed groups reported similar levels of negative emotion reactivity and word use, but the distanced group showed less ruminative processing in the narratives. An interaction emerged suggesting that ruminative processing was only associated with an increase in negative emotion in the immersed group and not in the distanced group. The findings are discussed in the context of decreasing risk for depression and related disorders by targeting emotion regulation strategies on a daily level. (C) Copyright 2016 Textrum Ltd.

To address whether brain systems are differentially involved during flexible vs. rigid utilization of a pre-existing allocentric representation, subjects encoded the position of six different target buildings relative to a centrally located landmark building in a virtual city seen from an aerial view. They then actively searched for the locations of these target buildings using the landmark (rigid retrieval) or using a previously shown target building in a novel fashion (flexible retrieval) while undergoing fMRI. Activations in posterior superior parietal cortex and precuneus were greater during more rigid than flexible forms of allocentric retrieval while activation in the hippocampus decreased linearly over blocks during flexible allocentric retrieval. A functional connectivity analysis further revealed significant interactions between hippocampus and these parietal areas during flexible compared with rigid allocentric retrieval. These results extend previous models of the neural basis of spatial navigation by suggesting that while the posterior superior parietal cortex/precuneus play an important role in allocentric representation, the hippocampus, and interactions between hippocampus and these parietal areas, are important for flexible utilization of these representations.","2013-05","2018-06-18 12:22:22","2018-06-18 12:22:22",NA,"1070-1087",NA,"","34",NA,"",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,"",NA,"","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.21494","Humans; Male; Female; Photic Stimulation; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mental Recall/*physiology; Oxygen/blood; Space Perception/*physiology; *Brain Mapping; Orientation/*physiology; Spatial Behavior/*physiology; Reaction Time/physiology; Cerebral Cortex/blood supply/*physiology; Neural Pathways/blood supply/physiology",NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reaction times revealed an interaction between the factors perspective and emotional valence. Faster responses occurred after positive words in the self-perspective condition. A similar interaction was observed in the ERP waveforms in the time range of the N400 component: smaller N400 amplitudes were elicited by positive stimuli compared to negative stimuli in the self-perspective condition, but not in the other-perspective condition. Similarly, a reversed pattern was found in the late positive component (LPC) at 415-815 ms. The present study suggests that shifts in perspectives between self and others can change self-appraisal, which in turn reduces egocentric biases of the self.

Statistically significant effects of the culture and language variables have been observed on a number of characteristics of the memories recalled by the subjects of this study. The sample of this study consists of forty college students, half of them men and half women, who are English/Spanish proficient bilinguals. For all subjects Spanish is the mother-tongue (the first language learned). Half of the sample are monocultural bilinguals, that is, they have lived all their lives in the same cultural setting. The other half, are bicultural bilinguals, that is, they have undergone a cultural transition after the age of seven. Two different methods have been used to collect personal (as opposed to semantic) memories. The subjects were asked to freely recall memories from two periods of their lives, i.e., zero to eight years and fourteen years to the present. Then English/Spanish translation equivalent pairs of words were used as prompts to elicit personal memories. The analysis indicates that a cultural transition significantly affects the accessibility of personal memories. Monoculturals, consistently and throughout a spectrum of memories, recalled earlier events than biculturals. The data on the effects of culture provides strong empirical support for the cognitive and cultural discontinuity hypothesis, originally proposed by Schachtel (1947) and by Neisser (1962) to explain childhood amnesia. It is also established that language has an effect on the mean age of occurrence of memories. Memories elicited by the Spanish word-prompts are significantly earlier than memories evoked by their English translation equivalents. In addition, memories recalled in Spanish tend to be clearer and carry trauma content more often than memories recalled in English. Two possible interpretations for these language-related findings are provided. The Nigro and Neisser (1983) findings on point of view of memory is confirmed. The observer perspective appears more often in remote memories, while the field perspective prevails in recent memories. The results are also consistent with the literature on the slight effects of gender on the characteristics of memories.
